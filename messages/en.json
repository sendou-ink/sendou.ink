	"faq_a1": "Plus Server is a Discord server for high-level players to look for people to play with and against. It was founded in September 2017. Divided into three tiers of which +1 is the highest. You get access when a member of the server suggests you and you pass the monthly voting or you place well enough on the SendouQ leaderboard.\n\nIn the voting you get a percentage based on your result. 0% would mean everyone who participated in the voting downvoted you while 100% would be the opposite. 60% is required to pass the voting. If a member gets a score below 60% they get demoted a tier, or in the case of +3, kicked.\n\nSee the leaderboards page for indicators about who is on track to get access via that method. 60 people in total get access each season - 10 to +1, 20 to +2 and 30 to +3.",

	"faq_q3": "How to update my avatar or username?",
	"faq_a3": "Updating username or avatar on Discord doesn't right away update them on sendou.ink. To make that happen you have two options:\n\n1) If you are a member of this website's Discord or the Plus Server you can simply wait. There is a routine that runs once a day that handles the updating.\n\n2) To get them to update right away you can use the /update-profile command of the Lohi Discord bot.",

	"faq_a4": "Make sure to connect your Discord on Patreon.com. After doing so it will take up to 2 hours for the status to update on the site. If you are having problems DM Sendou directly for help.",
	"faq_q5": "Is there a sendou.ink app?",
	"faq_a5": "No, but sendou.ink can be installed as a 'Progressive Web App' that gets many of the same benefits such as full-screen, an icon on the home screen and a separate process from the browser. Google 'how to install PWA on *your browser*' to see how.",
	"faq_q6": "How to add Twitch/Bluesky/YouTube to my profile?",
