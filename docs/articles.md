# Articles

1. Take an existing article as a base: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sendouc/sendou.ink/rewrite/content/articles/in-the-zone-26-winners.md
2. Copy and paste the contents to a text file
3. First, edit the info section at the top:

- "title" = title of the page
- "date" = date when this article was written (format YYYY-MM-DD)
- "author" = your name as you want it shown on the website

4. Write the actual article below the second `---`
5. You can use Markdown for more advanced formatting (read https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax for more info)
6. Name the file as you want the URL to be. For example `in-the-zone-26-winners.md` becomes `https://sendou.ink/a/in-the-zone-26-winners`
7. Send the file to Sendou (or open a pull request if you know how)
8. Optional: also send an image as .png if you want to show a link preview. The preferred dimensions are 1200 Ã— 630.
