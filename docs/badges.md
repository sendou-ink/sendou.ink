# Badge guide

## What are badges?

Badges are a virtual prize that users can win from tournaments and then display on their profile.

Current list of them can be seen here https://sendou.ink/badges

## Rules

Any badge to be added has to follow these rules. Badges that do not follow the rules will not be added to the site or can be removed at any time:

**Quality and consistency** has to be matching those already on the site.

**Uniqueness** i.e. the added badge has to be different enough from those already on the site.

**Variations** for a maximum of 3 per unique design (e.g. 1st, 2nd & 3rd place variations). For further additions it has be a completely different and unique design and not just recolor or small design changes.

**No AI** every badge has to be made by a human.

**Made for sendou.ink/approved usage** badges have to be commissioned for this exact purpose or otherwise agreed with the person who made them so that they fully understand what they are used for.

**As tournament prizes** the badge are meant to be given out as tournament prizes (awarded for reaching certain placement). If you have any other idea in mind then you need to check that with Sendou separately.

**One badge per tournament** as described above badges are meant to given out as tournament prizes and on top of that the basic rule is one badge can be earned by playing one tournament. If any other idea you need to check that with Sendou separately.

## Adding a new badge

1. First badge needs to be made
- 3D artists can use [picoCAD](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad)
- Some quick guide to picoCAD can be found pinned in the #badges Discord channel
- Others can use the "[badges" Discord channel](https://discord.gg/sendou) to inquire about a commission
- Read rules from above carefully at this point and ask if you do not understand something

2. Use [the tool](https://sendou-badge-uploader.pages.dev/) to upload the badge you made (credits for making the tool go to hfcRed)
- It will handle creating the assets for you and opening the pull request with the changes needed

3. Wait for Sendou to look into the pull request
- Sometimes this can take a while if Sendou is busy
- Changes might be requested (you can update the pull request made with the tool also)

4. Wait for the site to be updated
- After the pull request is merged it does not automatically go to the site yet
- Normally the site updates a couple times a week, but this can vary

5. Request permissions
- After you see your badge on the /badges page you can request manager permissions to it on from the staff on the helpdesk channel

6. Give out the badges to tournament winners
- Badge can be given out via the /badges page

## Updating a badge

Make a new pull request (also using the tool) making the changes you need. The `fileName` should always remain the same.
