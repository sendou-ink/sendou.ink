Investigate adding a visualization that shows the weapon ranges of a composition compared to meta staple weapons.

## Concept
- Display the effective ranges of weapons in the user's composition
- Compare against well-known meta weapons (e.g., Snipewriter) as reference points
- Help players understand their team's range coverage and gaps

## Research Needed
- What range data is available for weapons?
- How to best visualize overlapping ranges (bar chart, number line, etc.)?
- Which meta weapons make good reference points?
- How does this integrate with the existing Composition Analyzer UI?

## Potential Benefits
- Quickly identify if a comp is too short-range or lacks backline pressure
- Visual comparison helps newer players understand weapon roles
- Could highlight range mismatches in team compositions
