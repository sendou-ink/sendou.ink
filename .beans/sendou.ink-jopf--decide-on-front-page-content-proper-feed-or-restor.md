## Summary

The front page needs attention - either build out a proper activity feed or restore the previous front page content for now.

## Options

### Option A: Build proper feed
- Design and implement a real activity feed with relevant content
- Would include things like: recent tournament results, friend activity, team updates, community highlights
- More work but provides value

### Option B: Restore old front page
- Bring back the previous front page content/layout
- Quick solution to have something meaningful on the homepage
- Can revisit feed implementation later

## Decision needed

Decide which approach to take based on timeline and priorities.

## Checklist

- [ ] Decide on approach (feed vs restore old)
- [ ] Implement chosen solution
- [ ] Test on desktop and mobile
