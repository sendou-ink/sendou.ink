The AP sliders in the Composition Analyzer need styling improvements, particularly for mobile devices.

## Current Issues
- Slider thumb and track styling is basic/default
- Layout may not be optimal on smaller screens
- Ability icons appear misaligned with sliders

## Affected Sliders
- Enemy Sub Defense Up
- Enemy Ink Resistance Up

## Suggestions
- Style slider thumb and track to match site theme
- Ensure touch targets are large enough for mobile
- Improve alignment between labels, sliders, AP values, and icons
- Consider responsive layout adjustments for narrow screens
