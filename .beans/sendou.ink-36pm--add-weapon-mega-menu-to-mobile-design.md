## Problem

The desktop layout has a weapon mega menu in the top navigation bar that allows users to quickly access weapon-specific pages. This menu is missing from the mobile design, which uses bottom tab navigation instead.

## Context

Mobile users currently lack quick access to weapon-related content that desktop users have via the top menu bar category dropdowns.

## Possible approaches

- Add weapon navigation to the mobile menu modal
- Create a dedicated weapons section accessible from mobile tabs
- Integrate weapon categories into the existing mobile menu structure

## Acceptance criteria

- Mobile users can access the same weapon navigation options as desktop users
- Navigation is intuitive and follows the established mobile design patterns
