On narrow screens, the search/command palette category tabs (Users, Teams, Organizations, Tournaments) only show text labels without their icons. Icons should be visible on mobile to maintain visual consistency and improve scannability.

- The tabs currently show text-only on narrow screens
- Icons help users quickly identify categories
- Should match desktop behavior where icons are shown alongside text
