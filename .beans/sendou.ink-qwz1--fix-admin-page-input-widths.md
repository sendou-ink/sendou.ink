The admin page has inconsistent input widths - some inputs extend too wide while others are narrow (like the User dropdowns).

**Note:** With the incoming form rework, we might do a bigger overhaul of the admin UI anyway. This task may become part of that larger effort.

## Context
- "Impersonate user" text input stretches full width
- "Link player" User dropdown is very narrow compared to the Player ID input
- "Add as artist" and "Give video adder" User dropdowns are also narrow
- Overall form layout could be more consistent
