## Problem

On mobile, the bottom tab bar has a calendar icon labeled "Calendar" that opens the menu/navigation modal. This is confusing because there is an actual Calendar page in the app, and users may expect tapping "Calendar" to navigate there.

## Screenshot

The bottom tab shows a calendar icon with "Calendar" label, but it functions as the menu button.

## Expected behavior

The menu tab should have a label that clearly indicates it opens navigation/menu, not the Calendar page.

## Possible solutions

- Rename to "My Calendar" (check if fits)

## Acceptance criteria

- Mobile menu tab label clearly communicates its function
- No confusion with the actual Calendar page
