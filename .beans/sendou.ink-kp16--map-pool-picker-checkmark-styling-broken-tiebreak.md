## Description

The map pool picker component has two styling issues:

1. **Checkmark styling is broken** - The checkmarks on selected maps (e.g., Inkblot Art Academy, MakoMart) appear to have incorrect styling
2. **Tiebreak text is hard to read** - The "TIEBREAK" text overlay has poor contrast/readability against the map image background

## Expected behavior

- Checkmarks should have consistent, visible styling that matches the design system
- Tiebreak text should have sufficient contrast to be easily readable (similar to the "BANNED" text which appears more visible)
