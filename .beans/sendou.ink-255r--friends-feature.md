## Overview

Friends functionality for sendou.ink. Currently friends are mocked with placeholder data in the sidebar.

## Current State

- Friends list displays in sidebar (desktop) and mobile panel
- Data is mocked in `app/features/sidebar/routes/sidebar.ts` with placeholder avatars
- Friend items have empty `to=""` links - clicking them does nothing
- No real data integration exists

## Scope

TBD - needs design and requirements definition.
