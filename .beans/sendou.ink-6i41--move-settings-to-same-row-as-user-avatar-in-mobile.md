## Problem

On mobile, in the user tab modal, the Settings option is positioned at the bottom of the panel. It should instead be on the same row as the user avatar and name.

## Current behavior

- User avatar + name (Sendou) on one row
- Notifications section
- Settings at the bottom (separate location)

## Expected behavior

- User avatar + name + Settings on the same row
- Notifications section below

## Acceptance criteria

- Settings button/link is positioned on the same row as the user avatar and name
- Layout is balanced and visually clean
- Settings remains easily accessible
