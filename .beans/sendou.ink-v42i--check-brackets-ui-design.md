## Description

Review the brackets UI and decide on design questions:

## Checklist

- [ ] Should tabs (Main/Underground) be "attached" to brackets outline?
- [ ] Should "Add sub" link to a different page?
- [ ] Compactify button restyle needed?
- [ ] Do we need "Go to match" button when match info is already in the sidebar?
