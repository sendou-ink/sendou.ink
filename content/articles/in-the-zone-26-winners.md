Congratulations to Pink Venom for winning the final In The Zone tournament of Splatoon 2! In The Zone 26 featured 36 teams competing in Splat Zones matches. This was a double elimination tournament, so participants were guaranteed to play in at least two series of games.

Pink Venom was a mix of players from Starburst and Jackpot; two of the best teams in the NA region. Watching them mix their individual playstyles was certainly a sight to behold!

The runner-up team, EGirls4Victory, featured a few members of FTWin; another top NA team that recently disbanded. Could this new group be the start of a new competitive team looking to mesh before Splatoon 3 drops?

Taking the bronze medal was Comp, whose unorthodox playstyle became a highlight of the entire tournament. The team featured [IsabelT.J.](https://sendou.ink/u/isabeltj) using Tetra Dualies with masterful precision next to an Inkbrush and Ballpoint Splatling. Definitely not a team composition you see every day!

Rounding out the top four is the Woomierss. [Scar](https://sendou.ink/u/129931199383601153) is a long time member of the Splatoon community and it was a joy to watch them participate in this tournment. Will Splatoon 3 bring back more veterans to competitive play?

What better way for sendou.ink to send off Splatoon 2 than with a day full of intense competition. Thank you to all of the players who have participated in Sendou tournaments over the years. We can't wait to see what Splatoon 3 brings!
