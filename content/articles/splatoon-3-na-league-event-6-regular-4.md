# **NA League Event \#6 (Regular Season Week 4\)**

As October comes to a close, the Splatoon 3 North American League brings one weekend filled to the brim with Splatoon action\! More than just the League Show, Top 8 stream, and Sunday Scrim, Splatoween was also out in full force, and across the globe, LANs were aplenty. There was something for every Splatoon fan this weekend\!

## **The League Show Episode 6**

The Splatoon 3 North American League Show began with Jordan and Mellana recapping the events of last week’s Top 8 stream. They showed the current season standings, which have fofofo, Hypernova, and Duck Motif in the top spots. They followed up with a highlight reel of clips from past NA League events that didn’t make it into the livestream.

The promotional art for Splatoween was shown off ahead of the Splatfest that began later that night, transitioning into a segment that had community members showing off their in-game lockers and explaining the meaning behind the layout. Jordan, Mellana, Sapph, and Chara all shared their lockers in a down-to-earth, personal discussion that revealed a love for stickers, inspiration, crazy-good organization skills, and sentiment for the people that enrich our lives.

This week’s silly segment returned to Riptide, where Kbot had attendees play “Guess the Stage\!”. Players were shown a zoomed-in screenshot of a multiplayer map and had to guess where the screenshot was taken.

Shiny Tips came back with another edition where Zach discussed the parallel in plays from Urchin Underpass Rainmaker, between BEt vs. Hypernova and BEt vs. fofofo, where the key to victory was one player hiding by the unattended Rainmaker as the defending team ran ahead. The League Show then concluded with a reminder of events that the future still holds in store.

## **Top 8 Bracket**

Our commentator cast this week included Mellana, Popgun, and Sapph, with Power operating the spectator camera. At the time of writing, the stream has over 26,000 views, with a comparable run time to last week’s event.

This week, all of the teams in the top cut had previously participated in a Top 8 stream; no new faces this week\! This week, the Top 8 stream teams were:

1. Five  
2. Milky Way  
3. healthy diet food groups  
4. Moonlight  
5. FTWin  
6. Duck Motif  
7. BEt  
8. Triggerfish Zones Supremacy

The Splattercolor Screen was used in this week’s stream and the effects did appear on screen, so for those sensitive to it, please take caution if watching the replay.

### **Winner’s Quarterfinals \- healthy diet food groups vs. Duck Motif (2-3)**

Splat Zones on Barnacle & Dime opened with Duck Motif taking the zone first, briefly, before it was in healthy diet food groups’ hands, where it remained until the end of the first minute. The zone changed hands on and off; Duck Motif losing three players led to healthy diet food groups taking the first win in a knockout. The second game was Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins, where Duck Motif made a bold first score despite being three players down. Healthy diet food groups would again take down three before making their first push. They took the lead, which would hold them into the final minute. Vexen got a double on healthy diet food groups, which enabled Duck Motif to take the lead, resulting in a 74-55 win.

Game three went to Tower Control at MakoMart, which opened with healthy diet food groups riding the tower 13 seconds in. Their first push went to 74; unfortunately they wouldn’t be able to move it any further as Duck Motif kept up a persistent offense. Just over three minutes remaining, Duck Motif cleared their first checkpoint, giving them the lead, and the 62-26 win.

Game four, Rainmaker at Inkblot Art Academy, saw healthy diet food groups take a new approach, bringing out Mint and Charcoal Decavitators, Dapple Dualies, and Bamboozler 14 Mk I. They quickly went to a lead of 24, with style after zyf squid rolled over a Kraken Royale to inch the Rainmaker forward. Healthy diet food groups would employ stall tactics to secure a 76-29 win, after overtime. Lastly, game five, Turf War at Crableg Capital\! The most notable weapon change was blop on the REEF-LUX 450 with three slots of Special Charge Up, raining down Tenta Missiles 13 seconds into the game. With one minute to go, healthy diet food groups had the first Danger\! sign after being two players down over a 20-second period. The final looks on the map were clear: Duck Motif won, with a final score of 58.6% to 35.8%.

### **Winners Semifinals \- Five vs. FTWin (1-3)**

Heading into the Winner’s Semifinals is a matchup guaranteed to bring out the best top-level Splatoon gameplay: Five vs. FTWin on stream, with Milky Way vs Duck Motif on the other side of the winner’s bracket. In the loser’s bracket, it would be Moonlight against Triggerfish Zones Supremacy and healthy diet food groups against BEt.

Back-to-back Crableg Capital as game one started on Rainmaker. Both teams had their first checkpoint by the first minute; FTWin took down three of Five’s players and got the lead. Five then decided it was silly squid time; both Soulja and Thunder (carrying the Rainmaker) began squid bagging on the grates leading into FTWin’s base. Shortly after, FTWin wiped out Five, leading to the first set win, 71-61. Clam Blitz was game two, at Urchin Underpass, where first minute saw both teams lose half of their team, which ended in Five scoring first. \[K\]yo\! snuck into Five’s base and tried to give jumps to FTwin but got caught; FTWin went down three. Five got wiped out in overtime, and with just two players left standing, FTWin took the lead, 26-23.

Splat Zones at Inkblot Art Academy was next; Five dominated the game from the beginning, not giving FTWin a chance to take the zone at all, winning in a knockout less than a minute and a half into the game\! In game two, although Five took the first checkpoint in Tower Control at Museum d’Alfonsino, FTWin snowballed from their first checkpoint into the lead, and the second checkpoint, as Five cycled through players being splatted in pairs. Five wasn’t able to assemble a strong enough push to take the lead, ending the match 34-84, with FTWin advancing to Winner’s Finals.

### **Winner’s Finals \- FTWin vs. Milky Way (3-1)**

A repeat from two weeks ago, FTWin and Milky Way once again met in Winner’s Finals to fight for the best ticket to Grand Finals. Over in the loser’s bracket, the sets were Duck Motif vs. Moonlight and Five vs. BEt, as Triggerfish Zones Supremacy and healthy diet food groups exited the event.

Game one, Tower Control at Undertow Spillway, saw nearly identical weapon comps on both teams: Snipewriter 5H, Splat Dualies, and Slosher. FTWin had an S-BLAST ‘91 and Milky Way brought a Forge Splattershot Pro. FTWin would be the powerhouse in this game, taking the first checkpoint and a good lead into the second half of the game, where a fantastic cycle of specials let them sweep through the second checkpoint quickly. Things faltered for them as the game reached its last leg, and they would eventually fall short in overtime, 64-65.

Into Rainmaker at MakoMart, FTWin once again took the first checkpoint after splatting three of Milky Way’s players early. One minute later, they had the Rainmaker down to 19, but went down three players for it. This gave Milky Way the chance to get their first checkpoint, but forward progress was stopped by sam, who got a triple on them. In the final few seconds, as Milky Way raced toward the popped Rainmaker, it reset to the middle of the map before they could grab it and force overtime, leaving the score 81-59 for FTWin.

Clam Blitz at Museum d’Alfonsino was a game where neither team scored high, only making pushes one Power Clam at a time. Milky Way was the team to score first; it wasn’t more than a minute later that FTWin wiped them out and tied the scoreboard, pushing them behind one point. Milky Way threw another Power Clam at the basket; FTWin followed up with their own Power Clam, still trailing by one point. The game went into overtime–\[K\]yo\! put up a Big Bubbler and dashed beneath the basket, providing two jump spots for FTWin, who would dunk one final Power Clam into the basket for the win, 39-30.

Turf War at Hagglefish Market is a repeated game four selection from FTWin and Milky Way’s Grand Finals set two weeks ago. Most of the match was fought either around the middle block or in the side routes, with neither pushing into the enemy’s base. As 15 seconds remained, FTWin went down two players, but in the last three seconds, Milky Way was down to one player. FTWin’s fast inking earned them the 50.3% to 45.0% victory, for a total ink coverage of 95.3%, redeeming their 44.1% to 51.2% loss two weeks ago… which also adds up to a total ink coverage of 95.3%\!

### **Loser’s Semifinals \- Duck Motif vs. Five (0-3)**

Loser’s Finals would be Duck Motif vs. Five; the winner would advance to meet Milky Way in Loser’s Finals, for the opportunity to go to Grand Finals. Five was about to show just how much they wanted their chance to win a North American League event themselves…

Five speedran the first two games of the set. First, Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, where the match had already ended one minute and seventeen seconds in. Duck Motif looked confident going into the match; after all, they beat Hypernova on this same map and mode combination at that same timestamp (3:43) last week\! This week, however, it would be Five with the speedy knockout. Five knocked out Duck Motif again in Tower Control at Crableg Capital, which started with an early wipeout over Duck Motif. An unstoppable force of Five wreaking havoc in Duck Motif’s base led Five to their knockout at the 3:25 mark.

Fortunately for Duck Motif, Clam Blitz and Museum d’Alfonsino went better after switching off of their double-brush composition. Interestingly, it was redshell1–one of the West’s best Brush players–who made the switch to the Stickerz Splatana Stamper. The match started with Duck Motif taking down three of Five’s players within 30 seconds. Five scored first and got all the way to 37; finally, at 2:56, Duck Motif got their first points of the entire set, going down to 51 points remaining. The final victory would go to Five, 89-49.

### **Loser’s Finals \- Milky Way vs. Five (3-2)**

In Loser’s Finals, Five would be taking the runback against Milky Way from Event \#4, hoping to finally beat this adversary who has denied them a Top 8 stream victory more than once.

Game one started with Clam Blitz at Inkblot Art Academy. Milky Way scored first, managing to do so twice to get their lead to 47 before Five had their first opportunity for points. It took Five until just over a minute remaining to make a small, one Power Clam push, but 30 seconds later, taking two down with Killer Wail 5.1 enabled them to score again. It was not enough to take the lead; the game went into overtime, where Five wasn’t able to overcome their opponent’s score and was left behind 45-53.

Game two saw Five rush to the tower at MakoMart in the opening ten seconds to make a one-point push. Another ten seconds passed and Five took down three on Milky Way to drive the tower past the first checkpoint. Milky Way had an uphill battle to even get to their first checkpoint, with doubles, triples, and a wipeout in their way. They finally got through the first check with less than 30 seconds remaining. Since Five hadn’t pushed their tower much further, their score was surpassed with another last-second loss, 44-49.

In game three, Splat Zones at Urchin Underpass, it took almost 30 seconds for either team to claim the zone–which went to Milky Way. The next several minutes had the two teams flipping zone possession back and forth. Whenever Five thought they could extend their lead, Milky Way would reclaim the zone just long enough to apply penalty points before control went back to Five. With ten seconds left in the match, Milky Way wiped out Five just two ticks before they would have knocked out, but in overtime, Five recovered to win, 98-78.

Game four, Crableg Capital Rainmaker, saw speedrun-ready Five return. Not even 30 seconds into the game, Five acquired the lead and first checkpoint, taking advantage of Milky Way being down three players. As another 30 seconds passed, Milky Way got their first checkpoint and took the lead. This brought out a new fire from Five, who wanted that reverse sweep ticket to Grand Finals. Gos and Soulja teamed up to get a wipeout over Milky Way, leading to a knockout win before the clock reached the halfway point.

Game five saw Turf War at Hagglefish Market for the second time on stream. Both teams came in with similar picks of Splat Dualies, REEF-LUX 450, Slosher/Order Slosher, with the only difference being the Snipewriter 5H on Milky Way’s side, and Heavy Edit Splatling on Five’s. The opening was slow as teams played safe, but around the halfway point, plays were finally happening where more than one player was down at a time. As the last minute began, Milky Way was down two players and Five only one, and more and more splats increased the tension as the Danger\! sign hadn’t appeared in the UI for anyone yet. The end result would be Milky Way making their way back to Grand Finals with a 56.7% to 37.7% final score.

### **Grand Finals \- FTWin vs. Milky Way (2-3)**

Running back from two weeks ago, it’s Five in third place, with Milky Way walking into Grand Finals against FTWin. Last time, FTWin won in a close 3-2 set–can they do it one more time to keep their undefeated streak in the Splatoon 3 North American League Top 8 stream?

Rainmaker at MakoMart was the first game, and FTWin already wiped out Milky Way less than 30 seconds in to get their first checkpoint. Before the first minute was up, FTWin had the Rainmaker down to 25\. It took Milky Way nearly two minutes to get their first checkpoint, but once they passed it, they brought the game to a near-tie of 26-25. Almost at the 30-second remaining point, FTWin scored another wipeout, and as they played keep-away with the Rainmaker, the clock AND Rainmaker timer reached zero, giving FTWin the first set win by a narrow 75-74 lead.

Clam Blitz was chosen for game two for the third time in a row at Museum d’Alfonsino. Two minutes passed before points were put on the scoreboard. FTWin used a combo of Crab Tank, Big Bubbler, and Booyah Bomb to keep their push alive, bringing their score to 57\. They would persistently score again and again after taking down three members of Milky Way at once; the only time Milky Way could score was in overtime, which wouldn’t be enough to overcome their opponent, losing 23-82.

Tower Control at Hagglefish Market was next, once again seeing both teams with a Snipewriter 5H, Slosher, and Splat Dualies, with the S-BLAST ‘91 for FTWin and Forge Splattershot Pro on Milky Way. Milky Way took the lead first this time, splatting most of FTWin to open up the path to their first checkpoint. A wipeout over FTWin saw Milky Way get their second checkpoint with two minutes remaining. FTWin continued to fight, returning the wipeout on Milky Way at the 43-second mark, and getting their first checkpoint with 19 seconds to go. The game would last just a second into overtime before FTWin was forced from the tower, resulting in their first set loss, 64-81.

Splat Zones at Urchin Underpass, aptly described as a “tug of war” with the zone, saw a quick wipeout on FTWin 30 seconds into the game. It wouldn’t deter them for long, as FTWin would end up in the lead just over a minute later. Reinvigorated, sam would go on a five-player splat-streak. What followed that was a series of zone flips, eventually leading to FTWin wiping out Milky Way around the two minute mark. The zone would continue shuffling over and over, next favoring Milky Way. Overtime saw FTWin with their objective ticking down without penalty, but ultimately would get capped before they could take the lead, ending with another loss, 70-77.

The Top 8 stream went full circle with a game five Crableg Capital Turf War game both in Winner’s Quarterfinals and now in Grand Finals. We still saw unsurprising weapon compositions being same-y between teams, but with one twist as Milky Way brought out Custom Dualie Squelchers. At the halfway point, both teams were caught in the midst of an FTWin Booyah Bomb, and both came out of it with two players down. Milky Way saw Danger\! on their screens as the game neared its final 30 seconds, and the specials started to fly. The last looks were deceptive, appearing to be in FTWin’s favor, but instead, Lil Judd’s flag came out for Milky Way, with a 51.6% to 46.6% lead, and a new Turf War ink coverage record of 98.2%.

It was time for a bracket reset\!

### **Grand Finals Reset: FTWin vs. Milky Way (0-3)**

The bracket has reset, and now the first team to make it to three wins takes the Top 8 tournament for Event \#6. More than just a battle of skill, this set became a battle of endurance, as players had been in non-stop action for several hours.

The first game went back to Rainmaker at MakoMart. The game picked up momentum at 3:30 as Milky Way got their first checkpoint. This would be counteracted by FTWin, who wiped out Milky Way, took their first checkpoint, and the lead. There was a critical moment where FTWin stopped Milky Way’s Rainmaker carrier, but in the process got wiped out, leading to Milky Way taking the lead, just short of the final checkpoint. The lead would end up being too high for FTWin to surpass, ending with another loss for them 96-67 in overtime.

The second game went to Tower Control at Crableg Capital; both teams back with their similar weapon spread, with no specials unique to one team. FTWin took the first checkpoint shortly after 30 seconds, with Milky Way following up another 30 seconds later and taking the lead with them. Two minutes into the game, and FTWin had the lead back in their hands, now with the second checkpoint behind them. They would hold onto this lead until overtime, with Milky Way clearing their second checkpoint. Milky Way rode the tower long enough to pass FTWin’s current score, and another loss was tacked onto FTWin’s record, 71-72.

The last game of the stream was Splat Zones at Urchin Underpass. As we’ve seen plenty of times throughout this Top 8 bracket, the game was back and forth as the seconds and specials flew by. Rather than being a game of overcoming penalty points, it would be a task of holding the zone long enough to make a meaningful impact. The score remained relatively close, with both teams inching past one another until the final minute, where Milky Way took the lead from FTWin one final time, solidifying the set after a knockout.

The Splatoon 3 North American League is now past the halfway point, and has just one month left for teams to muster their best and reach new heights. No new faces were present in the Top 8 teams this week, but that all could change as the storyline develops\!
