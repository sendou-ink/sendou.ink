A new year brings with it the fresh promise of more LANs, whether that’s in the form of existing LANs continuing their legacy, or something brand new\! The big 2026 is almost upon us, and there’s plenty to warm up to in the coming months. 

The LAN Championship Showdown is returning, bigger and better than ever\! In 2025, LCS was made up of eight LANs:

- GatorLAN (2025’s LCS winners)  
- Booyah Bay  
- Sunset Surge  
- SeaBATTLE\!  
- H-Town Splashdown  
- New InkLAN  
- Chi-Shoals

In 2026, four additional LANs in North America enter the ring, bringing the total to 12 LANs showing up to throw down: 

- Don’t Flounder at the Function  
- Anarchy NoVA  
- SoCallie  
- Torontoroka

Qualifying events for the LAN Championship Showdown take place between January 2026 through early April 2026\. The championship tournament itself will be an online event, on Sunday, April 26th, 2026\.
