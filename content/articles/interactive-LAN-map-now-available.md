## *A resource to locate Splatoon LANs worldwide, now in one place*

On Wednesday, February 18th, 2026, Splatoon Stronghold published its latest community resource: an interactable map pinpointing Splatoon LAN locations around the world. Each map pin correlates to one LAN, and upon clicking on it, the map provides broad information at a glance.

At the most zoomed-out level, users will see a world map dotted with map pins of assorted colors and icons. A sidebar on the map can open up to show a list of every LAN on the map, visible and invisible. Immediately visible pins are for upcoming LANs, while invisible pins are for recent LANs which have already taken place. 

There is an option in the sidebar to turn on all invisible pins so the user can see LANs past (within a year), present, and future. 

LANs that have already passed will have a black map pin, and others will have one of several other colors: blue, green, orange, purple, gold. Blue pins denote small LANs (0-16 teams), green pins mean a medium-sized LAN (17 \- 32 teams), and orange pins indicate a large LAN (33+ teams). Purple pins show non-standard LANs. 

Gold pins highlight which LAN is a LAN Championship Showdown qualifying event, and a star in any map pin means that the LAN is among the LCS network. An exclamation mark means that the LAN is once-per-year or brand new.

*The map key and the LAN map.*

Upon selecting a LAN, either by clicking on the pin or choosing an event from the sidebar, the map will zoom in and open up an information box displaying this info: 

- LAN name  
- Box to open the event’s registration page in a new tab  
- The date the LAN will take place  
- The venue’s address  
- If applicable during multi-day LANs: which days the Splatoon event is hosted

If the map is difficult to use, users can click on the “MapHub” box in the lower right corner to be taken to the source map hosted on MapHub’s website, which has the same functionality as the embedded map on the Splatoon Stronghold website.

The map will be maintained regularly, keeping it up-to-date with new LAN announcements and keeping the LANs which have finished out of the way, for a clearer, de-cluttered opening. 

Sticking true to Splatoon Stronghold’s mission statement, beneath the map, there are additional resources for those unfamiliar with LANs or looking to volunteer or start their own.

*The first Splatoon Stronghold LAN roundup article from November 7, 2025, which sparked the idea to create the LAN map.*

The catalyst for the map’s creation came about as Splatoon Stronghold began writing bi-monthly LAN articles; we noticed that finding LAN information publicly and visually-beneficial in one place was difficult. 

Then, the feedback was twofold: LAN TOs thrilled that their events were becoming more visible, and Splatoon fans disappointed in the sparse LAN options outside of North America. This map aims to serve both concepts: continuing to promote LANs that TOs and volunteers work hard to produce, and help fans globally find their nearest LANs.

More than that, the goal is for this resource to encourage more fans to attend a LAN, no matter how big or small. The LAN experience truly cannot be replicated elsewhere in the scene, both as a competitor or just a spectator. Many players will often gas up LANs, and they aren’t exaggerating\! It really is all that they say it is\!

The release of this map comes right as North America’s LAN Championship Showdown 2026 settles into its qualification round, to determine which teams advance to the final event in late April. Hopefully it helps players realize an event is close enough to participate in\! 

The interactive LAN map can be found on Splatoon Stronghold’s website, here: [splatoonstronghold.com/lan-map](http://splatoonstronghold.com/lan-map).
