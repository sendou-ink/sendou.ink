# **Series Weapon Power Breakdown**

Splatoon 3’s Patch 10.0.0 in June 2025 introduced a new stat for high-achieving ranked players: Series Weapon Power. The introduction trailer didn’t spend much time discussing the ins and outs of this new feature, so let’s go over how to get your Series Weapon Power, Best Nine, and how it affects your matchmaking\! 

## **How To Acquire A Series Weapon Power & Your Best Nine**

In order to get a weapon’s Series Power, there are two prerequisites that you must meet: 

1. Reach S rank or higher in Anarchy Battle.   
2. Complete at least five matches in a series with a single weapon. 

After you’ve completed the five matches, using the same weapon for each battle, your Series Weapon Power will be calculated. Once you have unlocked it, this new stat will be visible in a few different areas: 

* On the Equip screen, press the ZL button while your weapon is selected and you’ll find it.   
* In the Match menu in the Lobby.   
* In SplatNet 3’s Weapons section, there are two tabs at the bottom–  
  * Weapon Data for all weapons; Series Weapon Power is the first statistic in the chart.   
  * Best Nine, which will show you your nine weapons with the highest Series Weapon Power\*. 

\*In order for the Best Nine tab to display any data for you, you must have a Series Weapon Power for nine or more individual weapons. Weapons with the same kits but different variants, such as Z+F Splat Charger and Z+F Splatterscope or Splat Dualies and Order Dualie Replicas, are counted as separate weapons and will have their own individual Series Weapon Power. 

Series Weapon Power and Best Nine are living statistics based on your gameplay—based on your match win/loss ratio with the specific weapon you have equipped. This means that as you play Anarchy Battle, your Series Weapon Power is being recalculated. The stat will be the same regardless of mode in Anarchy Battle, as it is tied to the weapon you have equipped. 

Since there are 173 weapon kits in the game as of Patch 10.0.0, that means if you wanted to get a Series Weapon Power for every weapon, you would need to play–and win–a minimum of 865 matches (if you won every match per series), or a maximum of 1,211 matches (if you won five and lost two in every series)\! 

However… 

## **How Long Does Series Weapon Power Last?**

Just like your rank in Anarchy Battle, once the current season ends, your Series Weapon Power will also reset. Since this stat was introduced during Sizzle Season 2025, the first reset will take place on September 1, 2025\. 

Although your stat will reset in-game, SplatNet 3 will continue to show you the highest Series Weapon Power that you have achieved per weapon. Use this to keep setting goals for yourself to get better\! 

## **Series Weapon Power Affects Matchmaking**

When queueing up to play multiplayer, Splatoon 3 will use Series Weapon Power to try matching you with players who have a similar power to the weapon you have equipped. This is to give you a challenge and chance to grow with your best weapons, and give you an easier time to build your skills with weapons you aren’t as great with. 

Does Series Weapon Power affect players outside of Anarchy Battle (Series) though? When playing in Anarchy Open, matchmaking will try to pair you against teams based on the skill level of the entire party, meaning if your party host is in S rank but everyone else is in B-C rank, you’ll be matched against a wide variety of skill levels. 

It’s important to keep in mind that when matchmaking, Series Weapon Power is not the only metric being measured when trying to put you in a match. Splatoon 3 will still try to match you with players in your region, or the lobby wait time, or players with a similar connection strength, among other values. So it’s not a guarantee that you will always get into a game against other players close to you in Weapon Power when playing a Series. 

Series Weapon Power is a neat little feature with a lot of nuance to it, and so far it seems to be well-received by the playerbase. It has a lot of potential to breathe new life to the competitive scene by giving players a new way to measure skill level that narrows down to weapon-specific capability, and we look forward to hearing how high it can go\!
