# **Upcoming Major Splatoon 3 Fall Tournaments**

September and October 2025 are bringing plenty of hustle and bustle with some big Splatoon 3 events online and at LANs, and even new details about Nintendo’s Splatoon 3 North American League. There’s a lot to be thrilled about as Splatoon 3 approaches its third anniversary and continues to prove that it’s not slowing down\! 

## **Riptide 2025 \- September 5 \- 7, 2025 (LAN, United States)**

Riptide 2025 has reached two major event-firsts in the past month\! Splatoon 3 signups for Riptide have been so numerous that for the first time in Riptide’s history, the hosting venue has moved the Splatoon 3 tournament front and center, where previously Artist’s Alley and the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate friendlies were held. Additionally, as of August 25, 2025, they have reached 462 signups and set a new record high for a Splatoon LAN in North America\! The previous standing record was 461, at Riptide 2024\. 

What else can you expect to see? Splatoon 3 will be lasting all weekend, Friday through Sunday, featuring both collegiate and non-collegiate events. All ranked modes (Splat Zones, Rainmaker, Clam Blitz, Tower Control) are in the rotation on a limited map list. The TOs have been making it clear to all Splatoon 3 competitors that there will **not** be support for Nintendo Switch 2 at Riptide. 

Aside from Splatoon 3, these games will also have featured events: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate & Super Smash Bros. Melee, Rivals of Aether I & II, and Mario Kart 8 DX. 

If you’re looking to take part in the action but aren’t able to make it to the event, IPL is looking for some help with easy tasks that you can do from home. Even if you’ve never done tasks like these before, they are happy to show you what needs to be done\! From their post: “The offsite support team is responsible for moderating stream chats, collecting clips of hype, funny, or interesting things that happen, and preparing and posting clips and other things to social media during the event.” 

Further details on what each task entails can be found on IPL’s Bluesky, here: [https://bsky.app/profile/iplabs.ink/post/3lx5oir77vs2a](https://bsky.app/profile/iplabs.ink/post/3lx5oir77vs2a). Volunteer applications for offsite support will end on September 1, 2025\. 

Riptide takes place between Friday, September 5 through Sunday, September 7, 2025, at the Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio. Competitor registration ends on August 29\. Spectator passes can be purchased day-of at the venue. More details can be found on the event’s page, here: [https://www.start.gg/tournament/riptide-2025-4/details](https://www.start.gg/tournament/riptide-2025-4/details). 

## **SuperJump 6 \- September 20 \- 21, 2025 (Online, Global)**

The sixth iteration of IPL’s Splatoon 3 major, SuperJump, is set to take place in late September. The last time IPL held SuperJump, it acted as a qualifier for the Splat World Series tournament and as such, saw some of the best teams from the West competing. This event promises to live up to the same hype; one month to go, and IPL is already able to announce that FTWin has clocked in for the major. 

This event will guarantee that all teams from Day 1 make it to Day 2\! The tournament will be double-elimination with a single-elimination redemption bracket on both days and is expected to follow the previous iteration’s map and mode rules, where all ranked modes are available. The prize pool starts at $250 USD, but donations will be accepted to increase the reward. 

SuperJump 6 will take place between Saturday, September 20 and Sunday, September 21, 2025\. Registration will close at six hours before the event begins at: 6 AM PDT / 7 AM EDT / 12 PM BST / 1 PM CEST / 8 PM JST / 9 PM AEST on September 20\. Rules and registration are here: [https://www.start.gg/tournament/superjump-6/details](https://www.start.gg/tournament/superjump-6/details). 

## **New InkLAN \#5 \- October 25, 2025 (LAN, United States)**

Hosted by the New England Squids, New InkLAN is the NES’s recurring Splatoon LAN at the Balance Patch esports center. This LAN event follows just four months behind its predecessor, New InkLAN \#4, in which the winning team of that event, Z Tier Players, qualified for the LAN Championship Showdown. 

The hosting location for the event, Balance Patch, has newly expanded their console collection to include support for the Nintendo Switch 2, per their website; just another option in an already widely-varied collection available to patrons. The site also boasts a video game-themed café with plenty of options for all types of gamers\! 

The venue does require all competitors under the age of 16 to be accompanied by a parent/guardian, so any interested players will need to pay close attention to which pass they are purchasing. Registration ends on October 24–one day before the event–but offers early bird options at reduced prices. 

New InkLAN \#5 will be held on Saturday, October 25, 2025 at the Balance Patch in Boston, Massachusetts. For information about the event and location, check out the start.gg page: [https://www.start.gg/tournament/new-inklan-5/details](https://www.start.gg/tournament/new-inklan-5/details). 

And even further down the road, we have Nintendo’s Splatoon 3 North American League to look forward to. Nintendo has announced that more information on the League will be revealed on Tuesday, September 2, 2025 (just one week before Splatoon 3’s third anniversary\!). Stay tuned as competitive Splatoon continues to snowball towards the end of 2025\!
