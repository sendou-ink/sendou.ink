# **Splatoon 3 North American League Event \#4 (Regular Season Week 2\)**

The Regular Season continues for the Splatoon 3 North American League, whose latest event took place on Saturday, October 11, 2025\. The League event will last until November 22, 2025 as teams fight to earn points based on their placement, which apply towards their eligibility for the Playoffs in December. 

## **The League Show Episode 4**

As we can expect, the Splatoon 3 North American League Show opened up with a recap of last week’s Top 8 stream and the current team standings, with the top 3 teams so far being Milky Way, Five, and Moonlight. 

The silly segment brought Rissa, Popgun, and Sapph to play hide and seek with Zach and Jordan. Played in Turf War, every match, one player would be the Seeker, and the other four had 45 seconds to ink as much turf however they wanted, with the intent to hide. After 45 seconds, the Seeker would try to splat the others before the match ended. While the Hiders could not use any part of their kit after the first 45 seconds, they could move around. The segment highlighted how Splatoon, having many of its own modes, still has potential for players to invent their own ways to enjoy the game\!

After hide and seek, Mellana returned with her Salmon Run squad of Vicvillon, Magic, and Nox, to take the audience through another Salmon Run shift, to showcase how King Salmonid appearances worked and how to conquer the King. In the gameplay, the four took down Megalodontia, and explained Salmon Run scales and rewards. 

Zach followed up with another episode of Shiny Tips, recapping last week’s Grand Finals Reset game four between Five and Milky Way at Inkblot Art Academy Tower Control. The NA League show then concluded with a reminder of the events yet to come, and the schedule of events moving forward. 

## **Top 8 Bracket**
<img width="1200" height="470" alt="nal_r2_ladder" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8384b668-e378-415f-8239-8087587c443d" />

This week’s cast of commentators included Zach, Cyren, and Magic, and saw the return of CzarDB from the first Preseason event as the spectator camera operator. Compared to last week’s stream, which was almost five hours long, this week’s stream is just under four and a half hours in length, but had a comparable viewership at the time of writing (approx. 28,000 views). 

This week’s Top 8 teams included a mix of new and recurring faces, as we geared up to see these teams in action: 

1. Milky Way  
2. Five  
3. FTWin  
4. Halcyon  
5. healthy diet food groups   
6. fofofo  
7. Duck Motif  
8. Hypernova

FTWin would be making their first-ever appearance into the Splatoon 3 North American League starting with the fourth event; Halcyon and healthy diet food groups, while not new to the event, were new to the Top 8 stream. The other five have all been in the Top 8 in previous weeks. 

The Winner’s Quarterfinals would kick off with Halcyon vs. healthy diet food groups as the first set on stream, with the entire round looking like this: 

- Milky Way vs. Hypernova  
- Halcyon vs. healthy diet FG  
- Five vs. Duck Motif  
- FTWin vs. fofofo

As always, please keep in mind when watching replays or successive Top 8 streams that the Splattercolor Screen is active and teams are using it, which means its audio and visual effects may appear on stream. 

### **Winner’s Quarterfinals: Halcyon vs. Healthy Diet Food Groups (3-1)**

Halcyon and healthy diet food groups (healthy diet FG) went to Splat Zones at Um’ami Ruins for game one. Halcyon took an early and secure lead over healthy diet FG; the zone went to healthy diet FG briefly before returning to Halcyon. Healthy diet FG took the zone again and began their lockout. A Booyah Bomb destroying Halcyon’s Crab Tank was instrumental to healthy diet FG securing the knockout win, with over a minute and a half remaining. Next in line was Clam Blitz at Museum d’Alfonsino, which saw healthy diet FG take the first points in a small push of just one Power Clam. With about two minutes remaining, Halcyon brought the score to a close 70-67, but when the clock had less than 30 seconds to go, they would take the lead, and the win, 64-33. 

Game three went to Inkblot Art Academy for Tower Control, which saw an incredible opening from healthy diet FG. One minute in, and their objective had just 25 ticks to go to knock out. Things evened out after another minute as Halcyon took their second checkpoint, which became the lead, then the match, as Halcyon won in a knockout. The final game was Rainmaker at Undertow Spillway–which had to be restarted due to a disconnect. The game started slow, taking two minutes for the first checkpoint to be cleared, which would be Halcyon’s. Halcyon sprung off of that lead to turn the first checkpoint into 17 points to win. In the final 20 seconds of the game, healthy diet FG was able to get their first checkpoint with 12 seconds on the clock, but lost the Rainmaker as the clock reached zero, with Halcyon winning 83-40. 

### **Winner’s Semifinals: Five vs. FTWin (1-3)**

Following last round’s H vs. H set, Winner’s Semifinals had on their hands an F vs. F set between Five and FTWin. Halcyon would be going against Milky Way on the other side of the Winner’s Bracket; in the Loser’s Top 8, healthy diet food groups would be facing Hypernova, and fofofo would be against Duck Motif. 

Splat Zones at Urchin Underpass would start the set; a key triple on FTWin let Five stop FTWin from an early knockout by enabling them to retake the zone. The knockout went to FTWin anyway, with \[K\]yo cheering “Booyah\!” as the clock fell below two minutes remaining and the match closed early. Rainmaker at Humpback Pump Track saw new weapon picks as Five traded Thunder’s Splat Dualies for N-ZAP ‘85, and FTWin’s rafe switched to Ballpoint Splatling Nouveau. FTWin pushed to 9 points to knock out, about three and a half minutes left. In a breath-holding overtime, Five spent almost all of the Rainmaker’s timer trying to secure a safe advance. Steps from the lead, the Rainmaker timer at seven seconds, and FTWin splatted the carrier, taking their next win 91-78. 

Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins was up for game three–it took over half of the match for any points to be scored as both teams clashed at a stalemate until Five took the first points. Just over a minute remaining, as sam distracted Five for a double, FTWin took the lead. Then, 13 seconds left, Five retook the lead and scored their first win, 88-64. Tower Control at MakoMart shared the same intensity; this time FTWin scored first, with their first push ending at 53 points over three and a half minutes remaining. Less than a minute later, Five took the lead, which they held onto as three players went down on Five’s side and two on FTWin. FTWin snatched the lead with 40 seconds left, and although the game went into overtime, FTWin’s final score was 66-62. 

### **Winner’s Finals: Milky Way vs. FTWin (0-3)**

FTWin would next face Milky Way on stream in Winner’s Finals. In the Loser’s Bracket, Five would win 3-0 over healthy diet food groups to face fofofo, who went 3-1 over Halcyon to advance to Loser’s Semifinals. Hypernova and Duck Motif were out of the tournament after the Loser’s Top 8 round. 

Back to Splat Zones at Urchin Underpass for game one. FTWin was quick to take the lead, but it wasn’t the strongest, and after the first minute, Milky Way was on their way to run ahead. It took about another minute for FTWin to retake their lead from Milky Way, and at exactly the halfway point on the clock (2:30), FTWin had themselves a very early knockout victory over Milky Way. 

Tower Control at Crableg Capital was game two’s setting, not seeing much in the way of difference in the weapon choices on both teams. Both had a Slosher, Splat Dualies, and Snipewriter 5H; the only differences were a Splattershot Pro FRZ-N on Milky Way and an S-BLAST ‘91 on FTWin. Similarly, the game sat at a score of 84-88 (favoring Milky Way) for minutes as both teams made it to, but not through, the first checkpoint. FTWin would be the first to do so, with 1:43 on the clock, taking their score all the way from 88 to 23\. Even in overtime, Milky Way wouldn’t have the opportunity to pass their first checkpoint, as FTWin secured another victory, 81-16. 

Rainmaker at Museum d’Alfonsino next, and had both teams trying to get a safeway before grabbing the Rainmaker. It took almost two minutes for the Rainmaker to move, which was done by Milky Way, who took it to but not through the first checkpoint; two minutes later, they would finally get it. FTWin retaliated, and with 40 seconds on the clock, they sat behind by just one point. Milky Way grabbed the Rainmaker with the intent to get it off of the platform, but a clutch Zipcaster saved the Rainmaker before it went overboard, giving FTWin the chance to steal the lead with 22 seconds remaining. The game would go into overtime, but Milky Way’s efforts weren’t enough to get past FTWin, who would now go to Grand Finals after their 67-58 win\! 

### **Loser’s Semifinals: Five vs. fofofo (3-1)**

Not done yet with the F vs. F names, as Five faced fofofo in the Loser’s Semifinals. The winner of this set would advance to Loser’s Finals against Milky Way to determine who would make it to Grand Finals and see FTWin. 

Up first we saw Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, and already close to the end of the first minute, Five had the zone down to 38 ticks remaining. While Five would end up with penalty points, fofofo’s Ultra Stamp denied Five the chance to get far. As the clock ticked past a minute and a half remaining, a wipeout preluded fofofo’s knockout loss. Tower Control at MakoMart would see even more wipeouts; fofofo would wipe out Five at the three-minute mark; 20 seconds later Five would return the favor with a wipeout of their own over their opponent. Not finished, Five would get another wipeout on fofofo just 14 seconds left in the match–all these wipeouts, however, don’t spell just how close the match was, as Five’s victory was still a close 60-54. 

Game three was Clam Blitz at Inkblot Art Academy, and if the previous game wasn’t close enough, this one was just a hair from either team’s win\! Within the first minute, DATMENACE\! and 44F 3z descended on Thunder’s Crab Tank and shredded it. It cost fofofo two players, which gave Five the chance to score. Halfway through the game, fofofo made their first push–they went down three players to take the lead; the fourth would wait until Five left the open basket unattended to sneak in and score about 20 more points. Thirty seconds remaining, with three Power Clams in tow, Five tried to match fofofo’s lead, but fell short by one point, 37 to 36, and even in overtime, couldn’t add more to their name. Fofofo took their first game, 64-63\! 

The final game, Rainmaker at Humpback Pump Track, was a roller coaster–slow start, but wild ride to the end\! Five got a double on fofofo to get their first checkpoint, and the scoreboard remained stagnant until just under a minute and a half remained, where a triple on Five wasn’t enough to stop them from bringing their Rainmaker to 28\. Fofofo set up to counter, got their first checkpoint, and a commentator’s blessing heralded fofofo taking the lead, 24-28. Five fought back fiercely; the clock at 0:18, Rainmaker pushed to 26, but still behind with time against them. The spec cam shone the spotlight on Gos, and with .52 Gal in hand, gave the audience a show by getting a quad on fofofo and giving Five the opportunity to knockout with ten seconds remaining in the match. 

### **Loser’s Finals: Milky Way vs. Five (3-2)**

The feature of last week’s Splatoon 3 North American League Top 8, Milky Way vs. Five, who fought each other for a total of 12 games across three sets (including a Grand Finals and Grand Finals Reset) were once more squaring off in Loser’s Finals. The victor would take on FTWin: who would go back to Grand Finals for the second Top 8 in a row? 

It’s back-to-back to Rainmaker at Humpback Pump Track for Five; fully warmed up on the strategy, they got the Rainmaker to 38 by the end of the first minute. It wouldn’t take long for Milky Way to try for their first checkpoint, but were denied by Triple Inkstrikes, delaying their checkpoint dunk by almost a minute. Milky Way took the lead with just over a minute and a half in the match, but Five, no stranger to clutching up in the final seconds, retook their lead with 36 seconds remaining. Milky Way would bring the game into overtime and draw it out almost as long as possible, but with six seconds before the Rainmaker exploded, Five got the pick they needed for the 94-81 victory. 

Splat Zones at Crableg Capital, where plenty of Crab Tanks were inevitable as both teams sported a near-same composition of Splat Dualies, Snipewriter 5H, Slosher, and a Shooter, with Milky Way having the Splattershot Pro FRZ-N and Five having the .52 Gal. The game wouldn’t go in Five’s favor, initially seeing them wiped out before the first minute was up, and again with just over three minutes remaining on the clock. They weren’t able to hold the zone for very long, and even with Triple Inkstrikes as a last-ditch effort, would find themselves on the receiving end of a knockout loss. 

Tower Control at Inkblot Art Academy once more saw the same compositions on both sides, but turned tides in the favor of Five. In the first minute, they were already past their first checkpoint, and would pay Milky Way back for both wipeouts last match with one wipeout halfway through the game on their way to the second checkpoint, and then again just under a minute and a half to go. After the latter wipeout, only two players were left standing on the field, belonging to Five. The match went into overtime, and Five came out victorious, 88-13.  

Clam Blitz at Museum d’Alfonsino was now the set point for Five; if they won, they would go to Grand Finals. It did take just over halfway through the game for Milky Way to be the first team putting points on the scoreboard; one minute later, though going down three players, Five would claim that lead for themselves. Critically, as less than 30 seconds remained, Milky Way took the lead back, and the game went into overtime. As the seconds ticked down, Gos threw a Power Clam at the basket, but wouldn’t make it before the shutters closed and the final score for Five, 60-66, meant game five. 

Turf War at Hagglefish Market, the first time a game five–Turf War, and Hagglefish Market–appeared on this week’s Top 8 stream. Both teams had a Slosher, Splat Dualies, Snipewriter 5H, and REEF-LUX 450–Milky Way had the standard kit and Five had the MIL-K variant. The first half of the game was even, but under the halfway point, things started to turn as Danger flashed in the UI for Five, warning them that they were at the disadvantage. In the final 15 seconds, chaos ensued, resulting in Five with two players standing against Milky Way’s one. The situation sounded favorable for Five on paper, but Judd’s verdict reported the opposite, as Five would sit down at third place with a 43.6% \- 52.1% final score.  

### **Grand Finals: FTWin vs. Milky Way (3-2)**

Grand Finals. FTWin, having made their first appearance in the North American League four weeks in after a team rework. Milky Way, returning to Grand Finals for the second Regular Season week in a row. With FTWin walking away 3-0 against Milky Way in Winner’s Finals, how will the opposition handle the runback? 

Game one went to Rainmaker at Urchin Underpass. Both teams went back and forth; FTWin with the checkpoint first, then Milky Way before two minutes were up. By the halfway point, the game sat at a near-tie, 76-77 favoring FTWin. Things would look even for a bit, but a triple on FTWin would give Milky Way the lead, and with 43 seconds left on the clock, time was not on FTWin’s side, and saw the first game go to Milky Way, 54-44. 

Game two was Splat Zones at MakoMart. Eager for action, everyone piled into an early battle and FTWin went down three players, Milky Way down two, giving Milky Way the numbers advantage to take the lead in the first 30 seconds. They would hold the lead firmly; FTWin grabbed the zone before it was too late, and after just one minute, the scoreboard was 80-16, with FTWin having a long way to push. They went the distance, taking the lead just over two minutes in, but less than another minute later, Milky Way reclaimed it. The score was 3-6 on Milky Way’s side; 48 seconds to go and EVERYONE got splatted, with the exception of rafe, holding down the zone enough to get FTWin the knockout victory with a little over 30 seconds to spare. 

Game three at Tower Control at Undertow Spillway saw another near-identical composition from both teams–the only difference being Milky Way’s Splattershot Pro FRZ-N to FTWin’s Slosher. The game would start off on a good foot for Milky Way; at the second checkpoint one minute in, but the song would change in the next minute as FTWin wiped Milky Way out. That would snowball into FTWin taking the lead, finally getting past their second checkpoint, and into an overtime that lasted for a heartbeat before concluding, with a 54-48 victory to FTWin. 

Game four being Turf War at Hagglefish Market surprised everyone, to see that Turf War wasn’t the non-optional game five that nobody wanted. We saw the usual shakeups in teams fielding a variant of the REEF-LUX 450\. An early double on Milky Way 20 seconds into the game gave FTWin the first advantage of the map. Throughout the game, Milky Way was almost consistently down more players than FTWin, even going down three members in the final 30 seconds of the match, when a numbers advantage mattered the most. The final turning point would be just how far into FTWin’s turf that they had gotten by the time they started losing ground; FTWin would not ink fast enough to win the Turf War, going 44.1% to 51.2%. 

Game five. Clam Blitz. Barnacle & Dime. A minute and a half into the game, sam’s quad over Milky Way gave FTWin the first points. Not only was FTWin’s first push from 100 to 40, but Milky Way received a delayed wipeout. Down to the last minute, FTWin extended their lead, which would be a safety net as Milky Way scored their first points, 20 seconds left to go. Into overtime, Milky Way had the basket open, no penalty left, and were just a few clams away from the lead. Hexen’s Crab Tank denied the final-second lead-steal, claiming three picks, leading to a wipeout. As overtime ticked down and their opponents respawned, FTWin gathered into the middle of the match to celebrate their first NA League victory with a Booyah\!

FTWin made a splash with their first Splatoon 3 NA League appearance, and they promise more in the near future. With so many recognizable top level teams competing, and with smaller teams earning their place among them on the biggest streaming stage Splatoon has, the NA League continues to burn bright as the weeks pass\!
