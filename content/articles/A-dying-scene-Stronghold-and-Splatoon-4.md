All of the recent doomposts and videos about how the competitive Splatoon scene dying have stirred a lot of feelings in the community. For many, including me, these posts have begun igniting a spark to create and do more for the scene and game we all love.

The current problems in the scene are fixable, some more easily than others. I'm fortunate to have the resources and such an awesome team at Stronghold that shares my passion for the community. Next week we will be releasing our project roadmap for 2025, some of those projects are targeted at resolving current issues in the scene.

We've fallen into a dangerous cycle as a community. We've become reliant on a new game coming out to grow our scene. Before Splatoon 3 launched, the main topic of discussion in the scene was about how we need to prepare for the incoming players.

Very few people/orgs actually invested in setting up spaces and creating easy ways for new players to find the scene. IPL upped their production, Chara went all in on content creation, and Stronghold was founded as an entry point and crossroads for the scene with a website \+ discord.

We as a community need to start focusing now on building up our community and \*establishing\* services \*before\* Splatoon 4 launches. I strongly believe that we as a community blew it with the launch of Splatoon 3 \- we did not attract the player base we were expecting.

What we as a community CAN do:

* **UPLOAD** content on YouTube  
* **WATCH** videos \+ streams  
* **SHARE** services \+ websites  
* **VOLUNTEER** w/ orgs

Let's focus on growing with what we have now. Make it so that the scene can be EASILY found and understood from a simple google search of "competitive splatoon". Together, we as a community can fix this. It all starts with you.
