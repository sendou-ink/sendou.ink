# **Oktofest 2025**

After what feels like years of drought for the region, Europe’s newest Splatoon LAN major comes in the form of Oktofest 2025\! Competing players will have the opportunity to write themselves into the event’s history books by becoming the first-ever Oktofest winners.

Giving Europe its first LAN major after some time of only smaller local events, Oktofest brings with it the grandeur the EU scene has been missing. This is already proving successful, with 253 attendees and 24 teams signed up as of the 10th of October. Europe has long been overshadowed by the larger, much more active scene in the US; Oktofest won’t be obscured so easily, and it's now Europe’s time for the spotlight\!

Oktofest promises a high-quality LAN venue experience with a prize pool of at least €2000, with all proceeds from the funds raised going to covering venue costs and creating an even bigger prize pool\! The 4v4 Splatoon 3 tournament will be limited to Nintendo Switch consoles (no Nintendo Switch 2), and attendees are required to bring their own equipment (Switch, controller, charger for your controller, and game); however, TVs, console docks, and LAN cables will be provided. Third party controllers are not allowed, to remove the possibility of an unfair advantage through macros or other programmable features; however people with disabilities are exempt from this rule and should contact the Oktofest staff via [Discord](https://discord.gg/GVd2hceFvq) to inquire further.

Participants can also look forward to additional Salmon Run and Mario Kart World events, which can be signed up for during registration. A separate Event entry pass is required to take part in these events. The event hall will also accommodate artists who sign up for a merch table\! The tournament will be streamed on the [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/thatsrb2dude) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatSrb2DUDE) channels of ThatSrb2DUDE, which is bound to increase the reach of the event.

Additionally, JBL, uRage and Sandisk have all donated a range of tech goodies to be used as prizes for event winners, and Nintendo has provided merch which will be raffled to attendees, so everyone at the event will have a chance to take something home\!

Competition registration ends on October 22nd, 2025, a few days before the event, so if you are interested in attending, keep an eye on the dates\! Oktofest will be inside the XPERION Arena in Köln, Germany, and you can learn more about the event here: [https://www.start.gg/tournament/oktofest-2025/details](https://www.start.gg/tournament/oktofest-2025/details).
