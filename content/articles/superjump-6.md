# **SuperJump 6**

Between September 20 and 21, 2025, the Competitive Splatoon 3 major from Inkling Performance Labs, SuperJump, celebrated its promotion to quarterly-per-year with its sixth iteration. Following in the steps of SuperJump 5, which was in June 2025, and its predecessor, SuperJump 4 (July 2024), from this event onward, IPL plans to host the major every three months. 

SuperJump 6 shared a weekend with the Splatoon 3 North American League, resulting in an abnormally low turnout of just 56 teams, compared to the roughly 100 teams that SJ5 and 4 had. However, SuperJump 6 wasn’t without a star-studded cast, being the bigger prize for several top level teams, who chose to take part in the major over the first Preseason League event. 

The tournament was a two-day double-elimination event where all teams were guaranteed to make Day 2, seeded into the bracket based on their performance in the Day 1 groups. Sets were played to a Best of Five (Bo5), and all ranked modes (Tower Control, Rainmaker, Clam Blitz, and Splat Zones) were in rotation. While a ticket to Splat World Series was not the victor’s reward this time, there was a respectable $250 USD starting prize pool at stake. 

## **What are You Looking Forward To?** 

Between sets, viewers were treated to a handful of surprises. Interviews from Popgun with various commentators and teams, asking each what it means to them that SuperJump was now a quarterly-recurring tournament, and what it would take for the teams to win their first SuperJump. 

An advertisement for the upcoming late-October European LAN, Oktofest, was also presented. The ad promoted the LAN’s Splatoon 3, Salmon Run, and Mario Kart World events and 2,000€ minimum prize pool. If you’re interested in joining the first-ever Oktofest, you can find more details at [start.gg/tournament/oktofest-2025](http://start.gg/tournament/oktofest-2025). 

To an even greater surprise for the viewers, a beautiful cinematic trailer announced the return of Prism Break\! Now with a new double-elimination format that will seed players based on their sendou.ink power. No group stages to earn placement, just competition at your level from the get-go. Prism Break: Metamorphosis is scheduled to run biweekly on Sundays, hosted by Under Pressure, beginning at 10 AM PST / 12 PM CST / 1 PM EST. 

## **Winners Semi-Final: FTWin vs. Moonlight (3-0)**

As the earlier interview would remind everyone, FTWin has yet to claim a SuperJump victory for themselves. Seed \#2 and eager to earn the gold, FTWin breezed past Heavy Metal and BlankZ in earlier sets. Hot on their heels was Moonlight, seed \#3, who was meeting FTWin after previous set wins against Envy and Fruittella. In their interview with Popgun, when asked what team they “wanted a piece of” the most, Moonlight’s answer was FTWin, and SuperJump 6 was more than happy to oblige. 

The first two clashes these teams had in the set were pretty similar: Splat Zones, resulting in a knockout victory for FTWin. The first match, on Humpback Pump Track, was over in less than a minute and a half, all of the points to FTWin, going 100-0 immediately against their opponent. Moonlight was able to put up a stronger showing on the next match, at Mahi-Mahi Resort, even taking the lead from FTWin once, but would still lose the match. 

Rainmaker at Scorch Gorge was the last match in the set. The victory would still go to FTWin, but Moonlight would be able to stave off another knockout. Viewers would get to see an exciting shake-up in Chargers on the field, with both teams bringing out the Splatterscope to take advantage of the recently-buffed Ink Vac special. Moonlight’s Basil would take this one step further, having sported a different Charger in each match; first the oh-so-recognizable Snipewriter 5H, then the E-liter 4K, and lastly the Splatterscope. FTWin would be the team sniping the victory–of the match, and the set–with a final 60-36 score, and advancing to Winners Finals. 

## **Winners Finals: PxG vs FTWin (3-2)**

PxG was the last hurdle in FTWin’s way to add a SuperJump win to their books. Seeded \#1 for the tournament, PxG had all eyes on them. Their stake? Winning a second SuperJump in a row, having won SuperJump 5 last June. PxG wasn’t playing at their usual display of shutout set domination, with their current set scores looking like 3-1, 3-0, and 3-2 before entering Winners Finals. With a few of their teammates re-acclimating after playing on opposing teams leading up to Riptide, PxG was looking shakier than usual, and that weakness was what FTWin was banking on exploiting. 

Starting with Splat Zones–get used to this; every set from here on out begins with Splat Zones\!–at Um’ami Ruins, FTWin would manage to take a small lead for themselves early. The end result, however, would look much like their Humpback Pump Track match against Moonlight, with FTWin in Moonlight’s shoes, losing the match in a knockout after about a minute and a half. The next match wouldn’t look much better for FTWin. In Tower Control at Inkblot Art Academy, the tower was sitting in FTWin’s base longer than anywhere else, with PxG able to get their score to just 7 points left to knock out. In the final minute and a half, FTWin struggled to get six points for themselves, with one of them being earned in overtime, but ultimately PxG would win again, 93-6. 

The third game marked FTWin’s rise to the occasion–another Tower Control match. At Shipshape Cargo Co., FTWin’s opening push to 39 points remaining seemed like a high bar to meet. PxG would match that push and surpass it by five points, just shy of three minutes left in the match. FTWin would take the lead back with one minute to go, and with Crab Tank on the tower, cruise their way into a knockout victory of their own\! Up next was another game of Splat Zones at Mahi-Mahi Resort, which FTWin heavily favored. PxG wouldn’t let them have their way easily. The zone flipped hands frequently, and by the halfway point, was looking like the last win PxG needed to advance to Grand Finals. The last half of the game was all FTWin, forcing PxG to a game 5 by earning another knockout victory\!

PxG would take an early lead over FTWin, down to 44 points remaining already one minute into the Splat Zones match at Barnacle & Dime. Both teams were playing safely; there was scarcely a moment where more than two players were down among all eight. A Booyah Bomb at about two minutes left in the match prevented FTWin from taking the lead; with three players down and PxG out of penalty points, the lead grew ever distant. \[K\]yo, with a Reefslider, a “Booyah\!”, and a dream, slid into the zone to recap it before PxG could get too far ahead. Soulja tossed Triple Inkstrikes at the same time Sam hurled in a Booyah Bomb, and it was the Inkstrikes that recapped the zone for PxG. Soulja’s Inkstrikes retaking the zone a second time ended FTWin’s run in overtime, with a final score of 81-71, sending PxG to Grand Finals and FTWin to the Loser’s Bracket. 

## **Losers Semi-Finals: Oro Jackson vs. Moonlight (2-3)**

Of all the sets on stream at SuperJump 6, Oro Jackson vs. Moonlight had to be the most edge-of-your-seat set. It had everything\! Knockouts\! Close games\! All four modes\! Game five\! Storylines\! Oro Jackson hadn’t participated in SuperJump since SJ4 in 2024, where they were looking to reach above their previous \#3 placement. Moonlight was also looking to break their SuperJump bad luck streak and get a victory over FTWin. Whoever won this set would see FTWin in Losers Finals for a second chance at entering Grand Finals, with a minimum placement of \#3. 

Opening on Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, no surprises in the first minute: Moonlight took the first lead, then Oro Jackson took the zone. As the clock approached four minutes remaining… Oro Jackson was ahead of Moonlight. And they kept going. And going. From 100, down to just 3 points remaining, until Moonlight was able to flip the zone in their favor and give Oro Jackson a hefty 74 penalty points, with three minutes left in the game. All of a sudden, now it was Moonlight on a roll, close to passing Oro Jackson’s score. The fiercest fights took place in the last two minutes, with neither team able to burn through their large penalty point stock. Oro Jackson would take the first game, with a close score of 97-90. 

Splat Zones at Mahi-Mahi Resort showcased Moonlight’s slow-and-steady playstyle; first Moonlight took the zone, then lost the zone, then lost the lead, and Oro Jackson climbed closer to their goal. Moonlight would incrementally close the gap between scores. In the last two minutes of the game, they locked in to sweep Oro Jackson from behind. Knowing that an early victory was all theirs after scoring a wipeout with five ticks to go, Moonlight turned to the spectator camera and cheered “Booyah\!” as the match closed. Next up, Rainmaker at Undertow Spillway, would repeat a feat from the North American League’s own Losers Semi-Finals, where the match would be over in short order. As the camera focused on Promano taking out Nolan at the last checkpoint, in the background, Basil snuck by and dunked the Rainmaker at exactly four minutes remaining in the match, earning Moonlight their second knockout in a row\! 

Clam Blitz would be next, for the first time on stream since Winners Quarter-Final, on Scorch Gorge. An early wipeout on Oro Jackson gave Moonlight the first score of the game, and they would make a second, bringing them to a 31-100 lead that they would hold until two minutes left in the match. The next 30 seconds, however, would see Moonlight down three players, giving Oro Jackson their golden opportunity. They closed the gap, with a single Crab Tank fending off the majority of Moonlight, in what the commentators described as “the push of a lifetime”, to go 100 \- 0 in a single push and win in a knockout\! 

The set was then tied 2-2. The last game was Tower Control at Mako Mart. Oro Jackson moved the tower just one point before retreating. Moonlight returned with moving the tower two points forward before backing off, but taking down three members of their opposition gave them the first checkpoint in the game’s first 30 seconds. Oro Jackson broke through their first checkpoint with three and a half minutes remaining. Their continued push was broken up several times, but with determination, they pressed forward and took the lead with two and a half minutes to go. In the final minute of the match, the tower wouldn’t stray too far from the middle of the map, constantly contested. Fifteen seconds left now, and Oro Jackson started adding points to their score again, pressed against Moonlight defending their lead. However, the defense would wipe out the offense with ten seconds remaining, and Moonlight was back to cheering for their 51-44 victory while their opponents were still respawning. 

## **Losers Finals: FTWin vs Moonlight (3-1)**

Moonlight was back to knocking on FTWin’s doorstep, eager for the runback. Their earlier set against FTWin was shaky, but in Losers Finals, they were a different team, more than ready to fight over who wanted to win SuperJump 6 more. There were no closer scores at this event than in this set\! 

The two opening matches were Splat Zones. Up first, Hagglefish Market; both teams were constantly one-upping each other, never holding the lead for long. Just under two minutes on the clock, and FTWin was stopped from knocking out with one point left to go\! FTWin’s specials menaced Moonlight’s scoreboard, adding penalty after penalty as the clock ticked down. \[K\]yo’s Reefslider and Hexen’s Crab Tank were especially dominant, taking the zone and wiping out Moonlight with ten seconds to go. The final score was 99-94, for FTWin, and the next Splat Zones game would go to Robo ROM-en. Moonlight’s minute-long opening push gave them a huge advantage, with the score set at 26-100. FTWin retaliated, but by the halfway point, Moonlight was out of penalty points and once more moving forward. Both teams would fight in the zone, keeping it neutralized for about 15 seconds, before FTWin won the firefight. They would win the battle, but not the match, with the score ultimately favoring Moonlight 97-70. 

The two closing matches were Tower Control. Starting at Inkblot Art Academy, the tower didn’t travel very far in either direction; by the halfway point, the lead was barely in FTWin’s hands, 84-70. FTWin would slowly advance, but struggle getting the tower past the uninkable ramp and through the second checkpoint. Moonlight would succeed in holding the tower at the second checkpoint long enough to surpass FTWin’s score with one minute to go. Just three seconds left in the match, and FTWin was back at their second checkpoint, and took the lead by just a hair, 50-48, before overtime was needed\!

Lastly, both teams would go to Mako Mart, where the first minute was more skirmishing than tower-riding. Neither team would get past the first checkpoint until two minutes had gone by, with FTWin taking the lead from Moonlight in the process. Going into the final minute and a half of the game, FTWin had what felt like a safe lead, with 14 points left to go compared to Moonlight’s 75\. But there was no time for them to rest, especially in the last 30 seconds, where Moonlight rode the tower through two checkpoints and into overtime. It took a Booyah Bomb from Sam, that “gg special” that everyone has felt at least once, to keep Moonlight off the tower long enough for FTWin to take it, and the set, with a final score of 86-67. 

## **Grand Finals: PxG vs FTWin (3-0)**

Now it was FTWin’s turn for their chance at redemption\! On the grand stage sat PxG, already one SuperJump win to their name, and approaching them was FTWin, who wanted that title for themselves. 

For the last time in this tournament, we would see Splat Zones at Mahi-Mahi Resort. FTWin would take the role of aggressor, taking down two members of PxG in the first 15 seconds and claiming the zone in the process. PxG would ink fast enough to take the zone from FTWin, but FTWin moved even faster, splatting PxG’s players by doubles and triples to take back their territory. PxG found their footing halfway through the game and managed to finally take a small lead from FTWin by keeping them preoccupied in their base. At the final minute, the score was almost even, with PxG in the lead 32-35, both teams having about 25 penalty points. Less than 20 seconds now, and PxG was back to earning points again; FTWin went down three players in the last ten seconds, and the clock ran out before PxG could take the knockout. The final score was 96-65. 

FTWin’s counterpick was to Tower Control at Shipshape Cargo Co. From the onset, they were outpaced by PxG, who had managed to ride the tower to the last checkpoint in the first minute and a half; meanwhile FTWin had yet to take any points. FTWin wouldn’t ride the tower towards their objective until almost halfway through the game, but would manage to hold it through half of the first checkpoint before needing to retreat. For over 30 seconds, FTWin would throw everything at their disposal to keep PxG from advancing through the last checkpoint, and would eventually succeed at driving their opponent away as the game approached 45 seconds from ending. They kept up the momentum, clearing the first checkpoint with 15 seconds to go, but once their tower-defending Crab Tank got splatted, no one else could jump on the objective before time was up. PxG once again took the game, winning 74-48. 

The final game of SuperJump 6 was Tower Control at Hagglefish Market. FTWin, again, with a major first push, riding the tower from 100 to 51 in the first minute, finally being stopped by a Booyah Bomb and Trizooka from PxG. Like hornets, they would swarm back in, this time having to be warded off by Soulja’s Triple Inkstrikes thrown from inside PxG’s base. It took two minutes, but the tower was finally out of PxG’s base, and the defending champions were able to make their first push of the game, consisting of just three points. One minute later, Grey would get the tower through the first checkpoint. Grey and Gos danced on and off the tower, dodging specials and taking turns advancing the objective until finally PxG was in the lead. FTWin made their last push of the game with 15 seconds on the match clock, but would ultimately be wiped out in overtime, leading to an 85-54 win for PxG, and a 3-0 shutout victory in Grand Finals\!

PxG now holds two consecutive SuperJump victories. Will they be able to claim a third, when SuperJump 7 returns on December 6-7, 2025, just one week before the Splatoon 3 North American League Playoffs?
