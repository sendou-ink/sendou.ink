## **3rd Kits \- Weapons That Could Completely Alter the Metagame**

On Tuesday, June 10, 2025, Nintendo released a trailer showcasing a variety of content coming to the Splatoon series, including a new spin-off game, a new stage returning from Splatoon 1, and most importantly for the Competitive Splatoon scene, thirty new weapon kits coming June 12th.

Having now seen the weapon kits and their points for special, we have decided to analyse which new kits have the highest chance to shake up the metagame, and which we think will fail to impress. 

First, which weapons *are* getting third kits? From the trailer we can see each of the following weapons showcased with a new look:


## **Highest Potential**

While any weapon with the right circumstances has the potential to disrupt the meta, the new weapon kits that Splatoon Stronghold thinks will create the biggest shift are...

#### **Stickerz Splatana Stamper — Autobomb \- Booyah Bomb**

Though it already had two viable competitive kits, it would not be right to not mention a weapon considered by many to be the strongest in the game at current. Stamper is known for its amazing damage and combo numbers, allowing it to fight well alone or with others. Booyah Bomb, much like its base kit, gives Stamper some much-needed survivability, allowing it to play to its full aggressive potential with the safety of a special that allows it to continue the fight in a pinch. Requiring only 190 points for Booyah Bomb will also allow Stamper to focus on fighting and not worry about painting some turf to ensure consistent special output. Autobomb’s outside hitbox combos with Stamper’s large 70 damage hitbox, and allows it to locate shorter range weapons attempting to sneak up on it, helping to cover one of the weapon’s few weaknesses. Stamper’s least favoured mode historically has been Rainmaker, and this kit allows it to shine in that mode too; Stamper players now have a kit for every situation\!

#### **Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R — Suction Bomb \- Tacticooler**

As with Splatana Stamper, Rapid Pro has proven itself to be a powerful weapon that sees frequent use in high level Competitive Splatoon. Its Deco kit specifically has remained present in the meta for its synergistic chip damage-focused kit that allows it to be one of the few anchor weapons seeing usage in the era of Snipewriter. But now, Rapid Pro is able to overcome one of its major downsides: the need to run it alongside a Tacticooler weapon. This gives Rapid Blaster Pro WNT-R the chance to provide a viable alternative to Snipewriter for more aggressive team compositions, allowing for different types of weapons to excel with a more complementary backline cooler weapon. Time will tell if it can dethrone pencil as the king of the cooler anchors.

#### **Hornz Dread Wringer — Curling Bomb \- Crab Tank**

Dread Wringer has seen consistent amounts of usage in the competitive scene, being especially popular in Splat Zones with the ability to cap the zone instantly with Reefslider. The other game modes, however, have not been as favourable for it, with slider being notably less effective in modes other than Zones; this changes with the introduction of Hornz Dread Wringer. This weapon's incredible ability to paint, paired with only 200 points for special, allows it to output a large amount of what has been, since release, one of the most consistently strong specials in the game: Crab Tank. Having amazing combos with the main weapon, Crab allows Dread to keep up the pace and apply pressure from a distance. Its sub weapon, Curling Bomb, leaves a bit to be desired, but by no means ruins what is an incredible main and special weapon package, allowing it to move around quickly and get out of tight situations to keep its uptime high.

#### **Splat Charger CAM-O & Splatterscope CAM-O — Sprinkler \- Crab Tank**

In the world of Snipewriter, other weapons in the Charger class have seen limited usage, with kits that do not come close to rivalling that of pencil. While most of them are solid, there has been very little competition in the role of backline charger, until now. Sprinkler has proven to be a useful sub for the class on the aforementioned king of coolers, and will suit a similar purpose here to allow a consistent flow of paint. The big difference comes in that special weapon, Crab Tank. The positions Charger tends to play in are great vantage points to use Crab from, and vice versa. The two play in similar positions on the map, so you will never be far away from an optimal spot to use either your main or special with this kit\! 

#### **REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K — Torpedo \- Booyah Bomb**

Often considered cursed with bad kits, Reeflux is no stranger to use in Competitive Splatoon… just in its own way. Having long held a niche in Turf War, an infrequently played mode in the competitive scene, Reeflux has struggled to see usage in competitive due to its lack of powerful subs and specials, both of which are possessed by REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K. Torpedo is a perfect combo tool which allows it to take and finish fights more consistently, and a Booyah Bomb that it can output repeatedly–needing only 200 points to charge–could allow this weapon to see the usage it has long been lacking. This weapon now has the high paint output, the fast kill time, and the kit to boot, setting Reeflux up for its time in the spotlight.

## **Lowest Potential**

The main weapons in the above section are all on the list thanks to the kit they receive, rather than standing alone as just a strong main weapon. The best players make full use of their kit rather than relying only on one or two assets. A poor kit dooms a weapon to collect dust. So, which weapons do we think will be the last to leave the shelves of Ammo Knights? 

#### **Hoofz Dualie Squelchers — Point Sensor \- Splattercolor Screen**

Mourning spread across the entire Competitive Splatoon community upon the announcement of this weapon’s kit. Dualie Squelchers have three kits in the game now, and none of them are particularly good. The 40 damage from Splattercolor Screen has no combos with the Dualie Squelchers, requiring three hits to splat an enemy, making it still slow to slay and awkward to skirmish with. To add insult to injury, Hoofz Dualie Squelchers has no damaging sub-weapon to try to build combos off of, and no synergy with Screen. This kit feels like a sting compared to the rest of the new Dualies who received new kits that by contrast, are at least somewhat good. 

#### **Painbrush BRN-Z — Splash Wall \- Trizooka**

Painbrush BRN-Z sits in a weird spot where it has Trizooka, one of the best specials in the game with incredible range, and Splash Wall, a sub that wants its user to stand in place. Both on a highly-mobile weapon that wants to be on the front lines. An argument can be made that Splash Wall provides benefit to Painbrush as added protection during its vulnerable wind-up time, but with Splash Wall’s 60% ink tank consumption, this leaves you with just eight swings to accomplish something before your tank runs out. It’s not the worst kit added in patch 10.0.0, but it’s not a choice that competitive players are going to run for, either. 

#### **Splash-o-matic GCK-O — Toxic Mist \- Ink Storm**

As the first weapon kit revealed, you would think that they would want to start off with a bombshell surprise, but what we were met with was instead a bombshell disappointment. Players have been asking for Splash with Zipcaster for years, and when a new chance appeared, everyone’s hopes were dashed in an instant. Even with a low 180 points required for Ink Storm on a weapon with high paint output, it’s just not making the cut, especially when this short-range shooter doesn’t have a damaging bomb to pair its main damage or special with. There are three Splash kits in the game, and this one falls far below the other two, who have two heavily-favoured specials in competitive play, Crab Tank and Triple Inkstrike. 

Only time will tell which weapon kits will truly end up being game changers, but one thing is for certain, it’s impossible to not feel optimistic when such big changes to the game are incoming\!
