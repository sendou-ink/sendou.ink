# **NA League Event \#5 (Regular Season Week 3\)**

With the conclusion of Event \#5 of the Splatoon 3 North American League, we are now halfway through the League and getting steadily closer to knowing who will be making it to the Playoffs in December\! November 22 is about one month away, so every event will start to matter as only the top five placements per team will matter toward their Playoffs eligibility.

## **The League Show Episode 5**

The League Show opened with Jordan and Nine recapping the results of last week’s play, and getting into the standings for the season. Currently the top three teams are Milky Way, Five, and fofofo. Hypernova and Duck Motif are tied with 135 points.

They then let everyone know that participation in any League events–tournament, Sunday Scrim, or Playoffs–would earn players an exclusive Nintendo Switch Online profile picture of the event’s logo. Additionally, players who participate in the upcoming Splatoween Splatfest will also be able to get exclusive profile icons\!

Jordan and Nine would continue the Splatfest talk, bringing in Lily to talk about the most memorable of the bunch. They talked about maps, themes, ink colors, the betrayal at finding yourself on opposite sides of the Splatfest of a dear friend, and even argued about Team Rice winning the Bread vs. Rice vs. Pasta Splatfest.

Nine transitioned into a new segment where he gave EE a tutorial on how to get started in Splatoon 3\. This included taking EE through his first multiplayer battles and navigating movement options, positioning, specials, weapons, what information the results screen displayed, and changing up your Splashtag to stay fresh.

Zach would follow up with another quick Shiny Tips segment, breaking down game five of last week’s Grand Finals between FTWin and Milky Way, Clam Blitz at Barnacle & Dime. Finally, the episode concluded with the list of dates for all events on the horizon.

## **Top 8 Bracket**
<img width="1200" height="562" alt="nal_r3_ladder(1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535488d3-2ae8-47fe-9bda-701693673ae5" />

This week’s Top 8 stream was hosted by Nine, Kbot, and Chaedr, with Piko as the spectator camera operator. The stream duration was almost five hours long, and as of October 19, 2025, has over 23.7k views.

Even as we enter week three of the Regular season, we are still seeing new faces in the Top 8 stream\! This week, the Top 8 included:

1. Hypernova  
2. fofofo  
3. Gourmet Race  
4. Moonlight  
5. Duck Motif  
6. BEt  
7. Its Shrimple  
8. Halcyon

BEt and Its Shrimple are appearing in the Top 8 for the first time, with the rest all having been in at least one top cut stream previously. The Winner’s Quarterfinals would begin with Gourmet Race vs. BEt, which would be a great opening set, as this is BEt’s first time in top cut, and Gourmet Race, while having been in top cut before, has not been featured on stream yet, so it will be a first for both of them\!

### **Winner’s Quarterfinals: Gourmet Race vs. BEt (0-3)**

The first match took place at Hagglefish Market with Splat Zones as the mode. Gourmet Race had a brief lead before BEt swept in, claiming the lead before the first minute was up. Their lead was further bolstered by Triple Inkstrikes taking down most of Gourmet Race. Gourmet Race would stop BEt with just 15 ticks to win, and would kick off a special weapons showdown for possession of the zone, which resulted in Gourmet Race keeping it. Eventually, Gourmet Race went down three players, BEt down two, in a final fight that saw BEt take the first win of the Top 8 stream, in a knockout\!

The second game, Tower Control at Undertow Spillway, saw Gourmet Race run to the second checkpoint just over a minute in, finally stopped by a wipeout. Halfway through the clock, BEt cleared the first checkpoint, took the lead, second checkpoint, then third\! Their momentum halted with a return wipeout, stopping their push with 3 ticks to go. The final result was BEt winning again, 97-43. The third game went to Clam Blitz at Inkblot Art Academy. BEt going down three enabled Gourmet Race to score the first as 2:45 remained. About half a minute later, BEt made their first push and took the lead, but went down three players again, letting Gourmet Race get ahead. A wipeout on Gourmet Race in overtime secured BEt’s 3-0 set win, with a score of 55-30.

### **Winner’s Semifinals: Hypernova vs. Duck Motif (3-2)**

The Winner’s Semifinals set was delayed as we waited on the results of Moonlight vs. Duck Motif. In the end, the next round would see fofofo vs. BEt, with Hypernova vs. Duck Motif on stream, with Moonlight, Halcyon, Gourmet Race, and Its Shrimple in the Loser’s Bracket. This set was set for some champion action, as Duck Motif and Hypernova both won one Preseason Top 8 tournament each.

After about 30 minutes since the last set concluded, Winner’s Semifinals kicked off with Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, only for the first game to end after one minute and 17 seconds. Duck Motif took the zone as Hypernova lost three players; Hypernova did not get the chance to take the zone at all before Duck Motif had their knockout. Hypernova came back with vengeance for Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins. Thirty seconds in and Duck Motif was now down three players, giving Hypernova the chance to score down to 53\. They would score again and again, denying Duck Motif any opportunity to get a single point on the board, as Hypernova took the knockout win this time.

By game three, Rainmaker at Humpback Pump Track, it seemed like both teams were trying to speedrun the set\! If Duck Motif getting a knockout in 1m 17s sounded fast, they had a new record. Just over a minute into the game, Duck Motif wiped out Hypernova and took another knockout thanks to a special weapons barrage, this time in one minute and 12 seconds. Game four was Tower Control at Hagglefish Market. Hypernova took the first points, but after going down three players, Duck Motif got the lead. Shortly after, Hypernova wiped out their opponent and got the lead as Duck Motif went down three players. Their dominating push ended with their tower at 3 ticks. The game resulted in an overtime victory for Hypernova, 94-85.

Game five, mandatory Turf War, at Crableg Capital. While we’re used to seeing team compositions change to adapt to Turf War, both teams stuck to the weapons they were most comfortable with. Both teams played safely, with neither going down more than two players at once until 1:18 on the clock, when Hypernova got a critical wipeout over Duck Motif. Down to the final 30 seconds, Hypernova had one player standing to Duck Motif’s two. The final say was Judd’s, as the last looks at the map were too close to guess. The game, and set, went to Hypernova, 49.7% to 45.7%.

### **Winner’s Finals: Hypernova vs. fofofo (2-3)**

Moving into the Winner’s Finals set were Hypernova and fofofo. In the Loser’s Bracket, the Quarterfinals would see BEt vs. Moonlight and Duck Motif vs. Gourmet Race.

Splat Zones at MakoMart started quickly; not even 30 seconds into the match, Hypernova went down three, giving fofofo the ability to continue their lead. Hypernova took the zone from fofofo, who had just 19 ticks to knock out. The zone continued to flip back and forth between the teams, neither able to get through their penalty points. As the match neared its final 30 seconds, fofofo claimed the zone after a double on Hypernova, who had tied the score, pushing them one point behind. The game went to overtime–both teams threw paint at the neutral zone in a frenzy; the key to victory was Hypernova taking down DATMENACE\!, for a final score of 87-86.

Clam Blitz at Urchin Underpass saw weapons swap on both sides, with both bringing in Dapple Dualies and fofofo adding a Zink Mini Splatling. The first score would be fofofo’s; they threw two Power Clams into the basket at about 3:46. They wiped out Hypernova, and with two players left on fofofo’s team, they scored once more. Then they took down three of Hypernova’s players to score again–and repeated that same scenario. At 1:38 remaining, fofofo finally got wiped out, at the same time as their last clam was thrown, giving fofofo a knockout win.

Rainmaker at Crableg Capital started off on a much better foot for Hypernova, as they took the first checkpoint in about 30 seconds. Almost at the halfway point in the game, fofofo cleared their first checkpoint, following it up with a push powered by an Ink Vac to bring their Rainmaker all the way to 5 ticks. Hypernova rose to the challenge; one minute to go, both teams down two players, and Captain Happy weaved through fofofo’s defense to bring the Rainmaker to 4 ticks. The close score would be how the game ended after overtime, with Hypernova winning 96-95 in their second one-point victory of the set.

Turf War at Um’ami Ruins was the choice for game four–not game five, in a twist\! Hypernova’s weapon composition only changed by swapping the Splatana Wiper for the Deco variant; fofofo brought out an Inkbrush and REEF-LUX 450\. At the start of the last minute, the game had been mostly even, with no clear leader, but that changed as the spectator camera panned out to show the stage about 60% in favor of Hypernova. In the final few seconds, backed up in their spawn, Hypernova took a wipeout, and fofofo won 72.2% to 24.1%.

Tower Control at Museum d’Alfonsino had a clear MVP: 44F 3z. The lead and second checkpoint would be in fofofo’s hands, but Hypernova still had a chance to make a move. But starting with the final minute, fofofo’s 44F 3z went on an eight-player warpath; first it was one down, then another, followed by a double with one Ultra Stamp throw for a four-splat streak. 44F 3z then hunted down Hypernova’s Snipewriter 5H to start a new streak of successful 1v1s, and find pick after pick after pick, finally going down with Half. The final score was 98-58 and saw fofofo advance to Grand Finals.

### **Loser’s Semifinals: BEt vs. Duck Motif (3-1)**

The Loser’s Semifinals set was between BEt and Duck Motif, with the winner advancing to the Loser’s Finals to see who between them and Hypernova would make it to Grand Finals. 

The first game was Tower Control at Hagglefish Market; an opportunistic match that went down to the wire. It wouldn’t take long for BEt to clear their first checkpoint; they rode the tower to 19 ticks with three minutes to go. Most of BEt went down, which led to Duck Motif’s comeback. With 17 seconds left, Duck Motif was halted one point from the lead when three players were splatted. Despite their great effort, the 81-80 win went to BEt. Next, Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, started with an early lead for Duck Motif, but after a minute, they lost three players and the lead. They tried to retake with Triple Inkstrikes, but BEt deployed their own to keep the zone. Both teams went down two players while the zone remained neutral, leading to BEt winning in a knockout.

Turf War showed up as a game three pick\! It went to Um’ami Ruins for the second time on stream. Early in the game, redshell1 got a double, but that was most of the action until the final third of the game. The spec cam panned out as the clock reached 1:00, showing Duck Motif in the lead, with their spawn and the middle of the map in their color. BEt broke out of their base thanks to a Booyah Bomb and Triple Inkstrikes, and Zero\! even got an Ultra Stamp triple with less than 20 seconds to go; all of that effort still saw them end with a 45.6% to 51.0% loss to Duck Motif. The 96.6% turf coverage in this match is the highest in the NA League, beating out the previous record, Moonlight vs. fofofo in Event \#3, who had a 96.4% total turf cover.

Game four went to Clam Blitz at Undertow Spillway. Wasting no time, BEt already scored halfway through the first minute, with a tremendous 30-second push that brought them down to 20\. With under a minute and a half to go, Duck Motif finally evened the scoreboard, taking the lead when drift jumped in with the pity clam before getting wiped out. Less than fifteen seconds in the game, and BEt had their basket open–just three seconds remaining and they took the lead back\! The game went into overtime, leading to BEt taking the game 94-91, and the set 3-1.

### **Loser’s Finals: Hypernova vs. BEt (1-3)**

The penultimate set of Event \#5, between Hypernova and BEt. Both teams had already lost to fofofo in the Winner’s Bracket, so in addition to getting the revenge match in Grand Finals, there was another reward at stake. Would Hypernova have a chance to be the first team to win a second Top 8 stream, or would BEt pull an FTWin and win the first Top 8 stream that they participated in?

Splat Zones at MakoMart’s name of the game was trading. Whether it was trading zone control or trading player-for-player, the match was a back-and-forth. The first major push ended at 3:08 as Hypernova lost two players and the zone, which they took to 8 ticks remaining. When the clock reached the 2-minute range, both teams went down two players in a set of trades, repeated 30 seconds later. By the end of the third minute, BEt took the lead from Hypernova. They wouldn’t knock out thanks to Hypernova’s Tenta Missiles targeting players in the zone, raining enough ink to cap the zone. In the final two minutes, neither team got new points as they struggled to get through their hefty penalty point stock, meaning BEt would win, 98-92.

Tower Control at Museum d’Alfonsino saw Hypernova make the first move, getting the tower all the way to 51 by the end of the first minute. Both teams met in the corner and fought over the tower; no specials were deployed, and still each would end up with just one player standing by the end of the brawl. BEt made an opportunity of that mess and took their second checkpoint–and the lead–with about three minutes remaining. Three minutes was plenty of time for Hypernova to fight back, and with Synapse making a home in BEt’s spawn to keep them distracted, Hypernova took the lead with a little under two minutes to go. Another minute passed, and another lead change would see BEt taking another win, 94-76.

Clam Blitz at Barnacle & Dime began on the slower side. The teams kept their skirmishing in the middle of the map, with neither confident enough to push into the enemy base. It took two minutes for Hypernova to be the team to score first, and made a respectable push down to 45\. From here, they played the strongest defensive game; for most of the match, BEt had a plentiful clam economy, but even though dante\! got a triple, it took BEt until the final five seconds of the game to tie with Hypernova. Into overtime, the basket closed with the scores tied–as Splatoon favors the team who reached the points first, that meant the game closed with one point being subtracted from BEt’s score, giving Hypernova the win 55-54.

Rainmaker at Urchin Underpass closed the Loser’s Final set; both teams had their Snipewriter 5H switch to Dapple Dualies for Tacticooler coverage and Squid Beakons, the ultimate key to success. The game was BEt’s as they got the first checkpoint, and just past the 3:30 mark, took the Rainmaker to 48 before going down three. They made another push to 33, ending with both teams having two players standing. Hypernova left the Rainmaker, shield popped, unattended past the grates. CMO\! snuck behind and brought it all the way to 9 points left, which was nothing easy to overcome on a tight map like Urchin Underpass. A wipeout on Hypernova with about 20 seconds remaining sealed their fate, and with a final score of 91-18, BEt advanced to Grand Finals.

### **Grand Finals: fofofo vs. BEt (3-0)**

The Grand Finals set, between two teams who had yet to win a Top 8 tournament. Fofofo had been in a few up to this point, but never got this far, and BEt hadn’t participated in any Top 8 streams yet, so whoever came out on top would be a major boost to their teams’ points toward qualifying for the Playoffs in December. The last time these teams fought, in Winner’s Semifinals, fofofo went 3-0 against BEt; can they do it again?

Game one was Tower Control at Museum d’Alfonsino; BEt claimed the tower within the first ten seconds, then immediately went down two players for fofofo to take the lead ten seconds later. Their push saw them at the second checkpoint one minute into the match, and eventually down to 28\. Fofofo took the third checkpoint after a wipeout over BEt thanks to a Big Bubbler, but BEt’s Killer Wail 5.1 ended fofofo’s push at 2 ticks. With half of the game left to go, both teams met on the middle spinner and traded specials; BEt went down three players and fofofo two. BEt would finally get their first checkpoint in the last 15 seconds, but fofofo took the win, 98-41.

Game two, Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime, saw a major weapon change on BEt’s side, now including a Forge Splattershot Pro, Splash-o-matic, and Heavy Edit Splatling. One minute in, and both teams had their time with the zone and points on the board; fofofo was currently in control and had the lead. Three and a half minutes to go, a Booyah Bomb from BEt stopped fofofo at 18 points, and took down two players with it. Fofofo retook the lead quickly; BEt deployed a Crab Tank to neutralize the zone for 17 seconds, and another Booyah Bomb secured it for them. A strong showing on BEt’s side, but all of their specials couldn’t hold the zone enough, and fofofo took a knockout victory.

Game three went to Rainmaker Urchin Underpass, which BEt would remember well as the final game of their Loser’s Finals set against Hypernova. Both teams brought in some weapon changes, with BEt undergoing another major shift with Dapple Dualies, Twinklez Splat Dualies, and a returning Tenta Brella. Fofofo also switched to Dapple Dualies and brought out the Zink Mini Splatling again, and used their tools to take the first checkpoint 30 seconds in, but would get wiped out for the effort. Shortly after, BEt used their Ink Vac to take their first checkpoint, bringing the game to a near-tie. Fofofo wiped out BEt with less than a minute remaining and drove their lead to 15\.

What happened next would be reminiscent of BEt’s last Rainmaker Urchin Underpass game, where they won thanks to CMO\! sneaking behind Hypernova to snatch the unattended Rainmaker. With the Rainmaker on the ramp in BEt’s base, BEt ran ahead to meet fofofo, who had two respawning players and one on the retreat. What BEt wasn’t aware of, was DATMENACE\! hiding in the smallest patch of ink right beneath them. While the rest of fofofo was taking BEt’s attention, DATMENACE\!, spamming the “Booyah\!” button, ran to the Rainmaker and dunked it for a knockout victory, and the shutout 3-0 set, earning fofofo their first Top 8 Grand Finals gold\!

While the Splatoon 3 North American League is already halfway over, it feels like it’s only just begun. With each week continuing to see new faces in Top 8, the teams that qualify for the Playoffs don’t seem as predictable as originally thought.
