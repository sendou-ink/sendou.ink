# **Splatoon 3 North American League Event \#8 (Regular Season Week 6\)**

Only three more weeks are left in the Splatoon 3 North American League, and teams are starting to reach the point where they have played enough events to qualify for the Playoffs. The top five scores from each Regular Season week will be used to determine who makes it to the Playoffs, and some teams have already played in five events. While they don’t need to play more weeks, it is encouraged to try to overcome lower-scoring weeks to keep numbers high\!

# **The League Show Episode 8**

Jordan and Nine recapped last week’s NA League Top 8 action and relayed the current season standings, which see Duck Motif, fofofo, and Moonlight in the top 3 spots. Rain Dance, who has not been present in any of the Top 8 streams, is \#8, which goes to show that participating in every event is just as important as placing high in a few.

The game played this week involved showing clips from some of the best action in the Top 8 streams so far, hiding every piece of UI information, and having Magic, Nox, and Chaedr try to guess who the player performing the action was. Highlights included Gos’s quad on fofofo, JJaeigh defending the tower in overtime, DATMENACE\!’s triple on Hypernova, Omega’s Ultra Stamp triple on fofofo, Blob’s Inkjet quad on Triggerfish Zones Supremacy, and Thunder’s quad on Milky Way.

Zach hosted an outfit review segment following the guessing game, where he, EE, and Rissa showed off their characters’ outfits and ranked them from least to most fresh, including Nine and Mellana’s character fits as well. Zach then transitioned into an episode of Shiny Tips to elaborate on the plays from last week’s Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins game between Moonlight and Duck Motif. As always, the episode concluded with the dates for the rest to come\!

# **Top 8 Bracket**
<img width="1200" height="559" alt="nal_r6_ladder" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05a4af33-0a20-4f07-a334-ebc39e22193c" />

The commentator crew this week included Nine, Cyren, and Sapph, with Piko on the spectator camera. The stream lasted about four and a half hours in this game five-less Top 8 stream\! There were not new teams this week, but did see the return of DPS ONLY, who had not been in a Top 8 since Preseason Week 2 (under the name DPS Mostly):

1. Gourmet Race  
2. FTWin  
3. Sunset  
4. Hypernova  
5. healthy diet food groups  
6. BEt  
7. fofofo  
8. DPS ONLY

### **Winner’s Quarterfinals: Sunset vs. BEt (3-1)**

The first streamed set was between Sunset and BEt; the other matchups were Gourmet Race vs. DPS ONLY, Hypernova vs. healthy diet food groups, and FTWin vs. fofofo.

Event \#8 began with Splat Zones at Undertow Spillway, where the game flowed back and forth, with teams trading the lead. Sunset had the first and last moments of triumph, taking game one in a knockout victory with a handful of seconds left to spare. Game two was a different story: at Tower Control Hagglefish Market, BEt held the game in their hands, keeping the tower on Sunset’s side of the map more than anywhere else. Before even a minute had passed, they had already driven the tower to 38 points. Sunset tried fighting back, but they couldn’t even get their first checkpoint; the match ended in a win for BEt, 74-12.

Game three, Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins, was tug-of-war-esque, with the lead shifting each time a team scored. Sunset scored first while BEt was down half of their team; a minute later BEt had the lead, at the cost of being wiped out. After Sunset’s next push, the game was even—then, BEt wiped out Sunset and took an enormous lead, to just one point to win\! In the final ten seconds, Sunset’s successful jump-ins with Power Clams let them take the lead right as overtime began, leading to a second knockout victory\!

Game four went to Turf War at Urchin Underpass, and saw both teams wield a Slosher, REEF-LUX 450, Dapple Dualies, and Ultra Stamp. Throughout the match, it felt like there was always an Ultra Stamp omnipresent; if not physically, then being discussed by the commentators. By the final minute when the spectator camera panned out, the game looked even, but not too much later, Sunset had Danger\! on their screen for about ten seconds. Despite the scare, they would be the team winning the game and the set, out-inking BEt 52.3% to 45.6%.

### **Winner’s Semifinals: Gourmet Race vs. Hypernova (1-3)**

The Winner’s Semifinals focused on Gourmet Race and Hypernova; on the other side of the Winner’s bracket was FTWin vs. Sunset. In the Loser’s bracket, healthy diet food groups was up against DPS ONLY, while BEt faced fofofo.

Tower Control at Inkblot Art Academy kicked off the set, and from the start, Hypernova was forcing Gourmet Race down two players consistently. When their push was over, Hypernova had the tower at 20\. The game’s second half saw Gourmet Race reverse the odds: in 30 seconds, they took two checkpoints and were shy of the lead. In overtime, Hypernova saved their lead, taking the win, 80-77. Rainmaker at Urchin Underpass was next and an Ultra Stamp cleared a path for Hypernova to claim their first checkpoint and get past the grates. They got a wipeout over Gourmet Race with a double from the Rainmaker. The rest of the game was Hypernova wiping out Gourmet Race–four times in the latter half of the match, which ended in another Hypernova win, 82-62.

Clam Blitz at Um’ami Ruins saw Hypernova take the first charge to score first after dividing Gourmet Race’s attention with specials. Gourmet Race found an opening to score two Power Clams and then some, giving them a 23-point lead; soon they scored again, and in just two pushes, with about 40 seconds left in the game, Gourmet Race had their first set victory in a knockout\!

Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime closed out the Winner’s Semifinals. The matchup favored Gourmet Race, who had higher painting power than Hypernova, but HENLO made a statement in the first 30 seconds by getting an Ultra Stamp-powered triple, leading to a wipeout as Hypernova took the lead. Hypernova lost the zone a few times, but their offense gave them a great defense, and with just over a minute left in the game, their knockout was secured, and they advanced to the Winner’s Finals.

### **Winner’s Finals: Hypernova vs. FTWin (0-3)**

After each went 3-1 in Winner’s Semifinals, Hypernova and FTWin met to determine who goes to Grand Finals and who goes to Loser’s Finals. In the Loser’s bracket, DPS ONLY and BEt were out of the Top 8 stream, and the Quarterfinals saw Sunset vs. healthy diet food groups and Gourmet Race vs. fofofo.

Urchin Underpass, back for the third time, for Rainmaker twice now\! After taking the first checkpoint, with Triple Inkstrikes clearing the way, FTWin had a lead of 35\. Feeling comfortable, with two minutes remaining, they started stalling. With time against them, Hypernova fought back, taking their first checkpoint in the last minute. Grabbing the Rainmaker just frames before it reset, Flingking had the commentators losing their minds after nailing a triple on FTWin in one shot, earning the quad soon after. FTWin still took the victory, 65-57.

Going back to Tower Control Inkblot Art Academy, FTWin had their checkpoint cleared first, but not too much later, Hypernova was able to out-score them by causing a distraction inside of FTWin’s base. Nothing felt safe at any point; it seemed like there was always at least one special active providing a threat to either team. Just after the halfway point, FTWin took a two-point lead over Hypernova, who tried to contest it in overtime, and though they put up a valiant effort with a last-minute double on the tower, FTWin would retake it and win 47-45.

For the first time on the Top 8 stream, Turf War at Undertow Spillway appeared\! HENLO switched to the Splatana Wiper Deco, and had now played all three Wiper variants on stream. The game remained even up until the final minute–even when Piko showed the overhead view, the map looked tied. After FTWin saw Danger\! on their side with 40 seconds left, they locked in once \[K\]yo\! scored a REEF-LUX one-shot to stay alive and continue inking Hypernova’s turf. The final score was 52.3% to 45.3% in favor of FTWin, who scored the same 52.3% as Sunset in set one; if Hypernova had inked just 0.03% more, the score would have been the exact same as Winner’s Quarterfinals’ Turf War\!

### **Loser’s Semifinals: Sunset vs. fofofo (0-3)**

The Loser’s Semifinals was between Sunset and fofofo. The winner of this set would face Hypernova; regardless of the team that won, they would get a redemption shot at FTWin, who sent all three of the teams left to the Loser’s bracket.

Fofofo started–and ended–the set with a speedrun mentality; Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime saw fofofo already halfway through the objective one minute in. Sunset’s saving grace was cactuszack diving into the zone and setting up a Big Bubbler. They took the lead, but lost momentum when fofofo threw specials at the zone to take it. Fofofo had their first knockout victory at 1:46. Faster still, Tower Control at MakoMart saw Sunset move the tower first, just three points. This was all fofofo would let them get; their first push saw them all the way to 65 before regrouping. With just over 3 minutes remaining, a wipeout on Sunset is what let fofofo snowball: they got their second checkpoint, wiped out Sunset again, and knocked out again at 2:08.

And if you thought fofofo couldn’t do it again, Rainmaker at Crableg Capital disproved that; some composition changes saw DATMENACE\! (“datkid 444” this week), the NA League’s biggest Brush menace, switch to an S-BLAST ‘91. This was positive for fofofo, as not even 20 seconds in, Sunset was wiped out. This led to fofofo quickly getting all the way to 39\. Sunset fired back with a checkpoint clear, and using a Booyah Bomb as cover, drove the Rainmaker to 9 points\! Normally, that’s a winning score, if a team is able to defend it, but fofofo was soon back in Sunset’s base, and with an Ink Vac at hand, they were able to inch the Rainmaker forward, retake the lead, wipe out Sunset, and finally, at 2:05, knock out for the third time in a row, for a total set shutout.

### **Loser’s Finals: Hypernova vs. fofofo (1-3)**

Hypernova and fofofo would be the teams fighting for their revenge match against FTWin in Grand Finals. The last time these two teams fought, in Regular Season Week 3, the set went to a game five, with fofofo getting the win.

Game one went to Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime once again; both teams have knocked out on this stage in this event, and for the third time in a row, it would not disappoint\! Hypernova had the zone first and held onto it all the way to 16, when fofofo finally had a successful retake attempt after multiple failed ones. It would then be fofofo holding onto the lead, surpassing Hypernova after taking them down three teammates, for Barnacle & Dime’s three-for-three knockouts in the Top 8\!

Inkblot Art Academy at Tower Control–the only mode that Inkblot Art Academy has been chosen for so far this event. Fofofo took the first checkpoint, making a push to 57 early on. Hypernova wouldn’t get their first checkpoint until almost two minutes in, but once they did, their momentum let them run through the second checkpoint, all the way to 37\. Fofofo’s next run got their next checkpoint, but wiped out just shy of the lead. They returned to take the lead in the last minute, thanks to DATMENACE\!’s Zipcaster. Hypernova had won the previous two games on this map and mode, and would add another to the record after Flingking got a triple in the final seconds, leading to a wipeout on fofofo as overtime began. Hypernova just barely won, 72-71.

Game three, Clam Blitz at Urchin Underpass, was not forgiving for Hypernova–less than 30 seconds in, left with one player standing, unable to stop fofofo from scoring to 60\. Another 30 seconds later, and fofofo scored again, and would yet again, for their third score in less than two minutes. It wasn’t even fofofo’s specials giving them advantage states; over and over, they were winning their 1v1s against Hypernova, who consistently were down two or more players. Hypernova did not get a chance to score at all; the final score was 65 \- 0, to fofofo.

Game four was Rainmaker at Undertow Spillway, where Hypernova got an early wipeout on fofofo. This let them get their first checkpoint, but not much further than that. It wouldn’t take long for fofofo to follow up with their own checkpoint, then the lead. DATMENACE\!, hiding in the tiniest patch of ink by the Rainmaker in Hypernova’s base, was able to get the Rainmaker to 34\. Hypernova made another push to try for a game five, but ultimately could not pop the Rainmaker shield fast enough in overtime; fofofo won again, 66-48.

### **Grand Finals: FTWin vs. fofofo (1-3)**

Fofofo has clearly shown throughout this week’s Top 8 that they want their FTWin rematch fiercely; after losing against them in Grand Finals last week, fofofo has plenty of bones to pick with FTWin. FTWin, meanwhile, has a second-in-a-row NA League victory at stake, with the chance to become the first team to win three Top 8 streams. 

Rainmaker at MakoMart was the first pick and saw DATMENACE\! back on the S-BLAST ‘91. Fofofo took points first, but they did not get the checkpoint. This meant FTWin clearing their first check gave them the lead. After that, both teams ignored the objective and instead fought for a safe path forward. The next push was fofofo’s, who got their first checkpoint with 45 seconds left on the clock. Now with a one-point difference between teams, everyone fired desperately at the Rainmaker. Fofofo popped it thanks to an Ultra Stamp, which also took out FTWin’s Heavy Edit Splatling, creating a path for fofofo to take the lead, winning 53 to 49 in overtime.

Tower Control was the third mode on Urchin Underpass this week and opened up to FTWin taking their first checkpoint a little under a minute in. Fofofo struggled to get a sturdy foothold, being down two or three players constantly and ending up punished when trying to capitalize on FTWin’s jump-ins. Fofofo finally got their first checkpoint with a minute and a half remaining, but FTWin denied them an overtime opportunity to try to beat their score, ending in their first set win, 62-44.

For the fourth time in a row, Splat Zones at Barnacle & Dime appeared, and although it was close, it would *not* end in a knockout, finally breaking the ongoing streak. The match opened up explosively; 20 seconds in and already both teams had penalty points, and quickly saw FTWin down three players and fofofo down two as the objective ticked down for fofofo. FTWin had a tough time dealing with fofofo’s lockout, but would manage to break into mid to stop fofofo at 20 points. FTWin could not hold the zone very long–their safeguard against being knocked out was their Triple Inkstrikes, which managed to stop fofofo time and time again. Fofofo got a wipeout on FTWin as the clock reached zero, revealing the final score in favor of fofofo, 96-64.

Another broken streak: Inkblot Art Academy appeared, not on Tower Control, but Clam Blitz. Fofofo, in character, scored first, despite being down two players. The one-clam score would not hold; FTWin’s first basket attempt gave them the lead easily. Fofofo countered with another push, overtaking FTWin’s score, but ended up wiped out. Capitalizing on the wipeout, FTWin retook the lead. Over the next minute and a half, they opened the basket three more times; the score was 24-71. With 16 seconds left and just two players standing, fofofo scored again… and took the lead\! In overtime, FTWin tossed in a Power Clam, but it was only enough to clear their penalty points. They went down three players, and the fourth did not have the one clam needed to take the lead.

Fofofo won the game 78-76, and the Grand Finals set 3-1… But not the Top 8 stream yet, as now they had to do it again in a Grand Finals Reset\! 

### **Grand Finals Reset: FTWin vs. fofofo (1-3)**

The Grand Finals Reset opened up to Turf War, the last mode these two teams had yet to play against one another, and it was on Urchin Underpass. Both teams brought the REEF-LUX 450 MIL-K; FTWin saw it doing damage against them as not even a minute into the game, they were already seeing the Danger\! sign on their screens and fofofo in their base. Even going into the final minute, they were at a clear disadvantage, having been down two players frequently in the match; meanwhile it took until the last 30 seconds for fofofo to ever be down more than one player. With less than 15 seconds, FTWin still had the Danger\! warning, which would foretell the end result: fofofo winning 53.4% to 39.8%.

In another first for the NA League stream, Tower Control at Barnacle & Dime was chosen\! It was less than a minute before FTWin had their first checkpoint. However, a minute later, fofofo was evening the scoreboard; halfway through the clock, they took the lead, cleared their second and third checkpoint, and were well on their way to knocking out before a wipeout ended their push at 11\. FTWin’s comeback began with a Crab Tank taking down two players on fofofo to get their second checkpoint. Triple Inkstrikes and a Big Bubbler secured their third checkpoint, and finally, with 24 seconds remaining, FTWin knocked out fofofo to tie the set score.

Splat Zones at Undertow Spillway is an uncommon pick for good reason: all it takes is a sneeze to neutralize a zone, which was heavily on display in this game. Fofofo was the only one earning points for the first minute and a half; when FTWin took the zone, they had it just long enough to get one penalty point despite no progress made toward the objective, leaving them sitting at a total of 101 points to score\! They added real points to their name thirty seconds later, but the hold wouldn’t last. The latter half of the game was fofofo retaking the zone throughout countless zone neutralizations; while they scored high, they wouldn’t get a knockout that would have happened were they on any other map. The final score was a win for fofofo, 94-24.

Rainmaker at MakoMart was the final game of the Top 8 stream this week. It was a slow game, moving at such a snail’s pace that by the halfway point, neither team had any checkpoints. Fofofo cleared their first checkpoint almost three minutes into the game, and was able to carry it to 36\. FTWin didn’t get any points until the last minute of the game, getting their first checkpoint with 12 seconds remaining. Rainmaker in hand, clock ticking down to overtime, and not far to go to take the lead, FTWin met an Ultra Stamp head-on, losing the Rainmaker with one second left on the clock. Fofofo got their revenge on FTWin and achieved the prestige that comes with taking a second Top 8 stream victory, and beating FTWin not just once, but twice in Grand Finals\!

With just two more weeks left in the Splatoon 3 North American League and speculation already beginning to occur as teams’ season standings solidify, the next few weeks promise more hype to come\!
