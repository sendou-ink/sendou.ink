# **Updated Directory\!**

Splatoon Stronghold has recently restructured their community guides Directory, aiming to provide everyone with a better experience searching for resources to assist their Splatoon journey. New additions have been put into the Directory, and the Directory will be regularly maintained and updated, ensuring that relevant, high-quality content is added and a wide range of topics are represented. Whether it’s the basics of Splatoon 3, legacy content for older Splatoon titles, competitive how-to, managing mindset outside of the game, or any subject in between, the Directory aims to provide players with guides available at their fingertips. New and experienced players will have something to gain\! 

The main goal of this restructuring is to make the Directory easier to navigate. The spreadsheet has been sorted into four main tabs: 

#### **Gameplay, Kits & Modes**

- The basics of the game and related topics, such as motion controls, risk-taking in matches, movement techs, positioning, callouts, and more.   
- Wide array of guides for weapons, sub weapons, and specials, including how to build gear to make the most of your abilities.   
- Guides on all modes in the game–Ranked, Turf War, TableTurf, even Salmon Run; the Directory is not exclusive to content for competitive play\!  
- Outside-of-game guides, such as how to play in a tournament, how to search for scrims, and how to spectate in tournaments with the camera. 

#### **Comp Fundamentals**

- How to find your playstyle and weapon in preparation for competitive play, and how team compositions are created and work with one another.   
- More guides on effective callouts, both over the mic and using the in-game D-pad callout options.   
- Analysis on modes, mechanics, and mindset with a focus on competitive play, including top-level player thoughts. 

#### **Outside of the Game**

- Guides that focus on maintaining a healthy mentality while playing: noticing when things are having a positive or negative effect and how to overcome it.   
- How to optimize and settle into a comfortable controller setup that works for the player, including discussions on accessibility in-game.  
- Awareness and skill development talks, both towards improvement in the game and about creating content for others outside of the game.   
- Tournament organization topics and helping the community, resources for codes of conduct and keeping yourself safe in the scene. 

#### **Past Games**

- Legacy guides that provide information on topics that are locked to previous games, such as weapon guides for weapons that are not available in the current game\.   
- How mechanics and matchmaking worked in previous games\. 

#### **Content Creators**

- Collection of video game Content Creators with valuable videos (guides, analyses, mindset).   
- Some Creators are not Splatoon-focused channels but still have insight into general topics that can be beneficial for any video game. 

Guides within the Directory are linked to their original format; guides are marked as being either a written document or a video. Each tab is color-coded to make finding specific main category faster (Analysis, Awareness, Callouts, Discussion, Gamemodes, Gameplay, Gear, Intros/Basics, Salmon Run, Specials, Sub Weapons, TableTurf, Tech, Tournaments, Weapons), and each of these main categories has also been given a visually distinct emoji to help separate categories without making ease of distinction reliant on color. Columns are also filterable, so anyone looking for something very specific does not need to scroll through the entire Weapons category looking for a guide for Dualies. 

Regular maintenance will be performed on the Directory spreadsheet to ensure that guides are relevant and providing accurate, up-to-date information. An anticipated future addition to the Directory includes a new tab for Replay Codes, to provide the scene with access to match replays across many skill levels\! 

Part of the ongoing maintenance includes adding in new guides as they come to the Stronghold’s attention. The Splatoon Stronghold website’s Resources page has a submission form for anyone to fill out if they have any guide recommendations they think we should add, any requests for them to find guides on a specific topic, or for creators to submit if they have created a guide for the community and would like to share it. 

If you’d like to take a look at the Directory for yourself, you can find it on the Splatoon Stronghold website in the Resources tab, or by clicking here: [https://www.splatoonstronghold.com/resources](https://www.splatoonstronghold.com/resources). 

The Resources Team at Splatoon Stronghold put in a lot of hard work to make the Directory experience easier for the community, and will keep at it to fulfill the Stronghold’s mission of making resources accessible and available to all.
