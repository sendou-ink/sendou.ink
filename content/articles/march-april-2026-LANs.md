Last year, GatorLAN took home the first place gold, with Sunset Surge taking silver and Big Dapple getting bronze. LCS 2025 only had eight teams; 2026 has expanded to twelve teams. The action finds a home on [SplatoonTourney’s Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/SplatoonTourney), on Sunday, April 26th, 2026\.
