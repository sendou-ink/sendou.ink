# **The Road to Splat World Series: SuperJump 5**

On June 28 and 29, 2025, Competitive Splatoon 3 tournament SuperJump 5, hosted by Inkling Production Labs (IPL), saw close to 100 teams come together and battle it out in a Best of 5 double-elimination event, where all teams were guaranteed to make it to Day 2\. Every ranked mode (Rainmaker, Splat Zones, Clam Blitz, and Tower Control) was on the board, but the most exciting aspect of the event was Day 2, where the top four teams would earn their place representing the West on August 2, 2025 at Splat World Series, the ambitious collaboration between IPL and AREA CUP. 

Which teams rose above the rest and earned their place as the first four members of the West announced for the Splat World Series? 

# **Splat World Series Western Qualifying Teams:**  

## **PxG**

The players who make up PxG:

* Grey  
* Gos  
* Soulja  
* Yu

To say that PxG had a dominant run in SuperJump 5 would be an understatement. In the entirety of Day 2, from the beginning of Alpha Bracket to winning in Grand Finals, PxG only lost *one single game*. 

In the Winner’s Finals, PxG sent another SWS-qualifying team, Milk Duds, to the Loser’s Bracket, but would end up seeing them again in Grand Finals, where both times they won 3-0. 

## **Milk Duds**

The members of Milk Duds who played at SuperJump 5 are: 

* Ice\!  
* Jared  
* \[K\]yo  
* .q

Milk Duds became the second team to qualify for the Splat World Series after finishing Winner’s Semi-Finals 3-2 against Hypernova and going into Winner’s Finals against PxG. 

Milk Duds went 0-3 against PxG in Winner’s Finals and were sent to the Loser’s Bracket, but would soon see PxG again, after they went 3-0 against Vanguard in Loser’s Finals to return to Grand Finals. In the Grand Finals, they went 0-3 to PxG a second time, but all of the matches the second time around were very close. 

## **Vanguard**

Vanguard’s team roster for SuperJump 5 included: 

* jaysorawk\!  
* phoenix  
* Erza  
* Raiki

Vanguard holds the honor of being the only team at SuperJump 5 to win a match against PxG, which occurred in Winner’s Semi-Finals, where PxG sent Vanguard 1-3 to the Loser’s Bracket. 

In Loser’s Quarter-Finals, Vanguard faced Aura, a team who was highly expected to be one of the qualifying teams crowned for SWS at this event. At the end of the second game, Vanguard was 0-2, but locked in to advance, winning 3-2 against Aura, and going on to win 3-1 in Loser’s Semi-Finals against Hypernova. Vanguard finished their SuperJump 5 run going 0-3 in Loser’s Finals against Milk Duds and securing spot 3 of the West’s team for SWS. 

## **Hypernova**

These players make up team Hypernova: 

* Synapse  
* \[UF\]datman  
* henlo  
* Lexi

Another team who managed to win 3-2 against the highly-anticipated Aura and move forward in the event, where in Winner’s Semi-Finals, Hypernova would lose 2-3 to Milk Duds and be sent to the Loser’s Bracket. 

In Loser’s Semi-Finals, Hypernova would go against fellow SWS-qualifying team Vanguard but would have their SuperJump 5 run ended with a 1-3 score. Despite the run ending sooner than they may have wanted, they still secured fourth place in the event and earned their right to represent the West at the Splat World Series\! 

# **Grand Finals: PxG vs. Milk Duds**

What did the Grand Finals of SuperJump 5 look like? The final set of the event gave us a taste of what we’ll be seeing for Qualifier 1, Qualifier 2, and Splat World Series, as all of the games were Splat Zones. Each match was pretty close, but in the end, PxG’s reign would be absolute, and they would come out the other side as the champions of SuperJump 5\. 

Match 1: 

- Map: Mahi-Mahi Resort  
- Mode: Splat Zones   
- Result: PxG knockout 100 \- 20 against Milk Duds

Match 2:

- Map: Shipshape Cargo Co.  
- Mode: Splat Zones  
- Result: PxG wins 25 \- 36 against Milk Duds

Match 3: 

- Map: Barnacle & Dime   
- Mode: Splat Zones  
- Result PxG wins 19 \- 21 in the last few seconds against Milk Duds

The next set of qualifying Western teams will be determined at IPL’s Qualifier 1, running Saturday, July 19, 2025, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 7 PM CET. This event will be a single-day double-elimination tournament, Splat Zones only. Only the top two teams from this event will qualify for SWS. 

# **Splat World Series \- First Eastern Qualifying Team**

Following SuperJump 5, on June 30, IPL released a trailer announcing the first Eastern team participating in Splat World Series\! The team spotlight video focused on DragonREX, which is comprised of: 

* Momo  
* Norishio  
* Kotaji  
* KinoChannel

IPL will continue to release team spotlights in the future to announce which teams will be competing in Splat World Series. 

# **Surprise Announcement\!**

During a commentator’s break between shifting the stream from Winner’s Bracket to Loser’s Bracket for the Loser’s Semi-Finals, viewers were treated to a surprise trailer\! Collegiate Cephalopod Association (CCA), the college-level Competitive Splatoon organization, announced a special invitational edition for their fifth Booyah Bowl event: ***CCA Booyah Bowl All-Stars***. 

The SuperJump 5 advertisement, which was read on stream, said: 

“The CCA celebrates five years of history with a special edition of their Booyah Bowl invitational, inviting talent from every era of CCA history to play in a special, one-of-a-kind invitational. Join the CCA on Saturday, July 12 for all of the competition and festivities.”

More information regarding CCA Booyah Bowl All-Stars will be coming soon\! 

With all of the buzz surrounding the Splatoon community lately, there are plenty of eyes on the scene and all of the cool things that we’re doing. With the Splat World Series about one month away, the sequel to SuperJump 5–SuperJump 6–announced for September 20 \- 21, 2025, CCA Booyah Bowl All-Stars on the horizon, and Nintendo recently announcing the Splatoon 3 North American League, the scene has no intention of slowing down. Let’s look forward to the future and everything it holds\!
