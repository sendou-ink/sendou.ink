# **Raise 4 RAICES: Splatoon’s Community Script-Flip Raises 9x Its Goal for Charity**

## *In one tournament played by TOs across the globe, over $4,500 USD was raised for charity*

On Saturday, December 20, 2025, members of the Competitive Splatoon scene most familiar with behind-the-scenes operations put themselves center-stage to raise money for a noble cause. 

Tournament organizers, commentators, content creators, and many more put their hat into the ring for four rounds of Swiss into a single-elimination bracket. Furthering the theme of a “flipped script”, two players from FTWin–one of the best Competitive Splatoon teams in the West–were commentating: \[K\]yo and Shak\! 

The story begins one week prior to the tournament date, where captains for the 38 teams joined on stream, commentated by Fufu, Stormy, Cyren, and Sasu, to pick their teammates in a draft. 

Every participant was ranked in skill level from 1-4 (1 being the highest and 4 being the lowest), and each team could only have one player per skill level. The draft, which ran nearly two hours long, started with just $80 donated, and by the end, had raised $767.67\! This far surpassed the event’s expected funding, $500.

*The four hosts doing the “67” gesture as the total donations reached $767.67. Raise 4 RAICES’s [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/raise4raices.bsky.social) posted this with the caption, “Necessary sacrifices were made”.*

The charity that the tournament was raising money for is [RAICES Texas](https://raicestexas.org/), a nonprofit organization providing pro-bono and low-cost legal assistance for immigrants in Texas (United States). The nonprofit also connects those in need to community resources, partakes in social services, and advocates for immigrants’ rights. 

There were two stretch goals for the donations: the first one, at $750 raised, Popgun, host for the Popcast on Monday nights and well-known for being bald, would have to wear a wig for the entire Popcast episode on Monday, December 29\. To raise the stakes, Cyren also agreed to wear a bald cap.

Going into tournament day, with the $500 donation goal already surpassed, the fun began\! The stream started with $1,531.67 in the donation bank, and would need to reach $3,000 for the second stretch goal, being an IPL sneak peek announcement\! 

There were five brackets following the Group stage: Alpha (which was streamed), Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. Just about every set had at least one alternate stream from a player’s perspective–at least 40 streams were happening at once\! 

The Group Stage and Round 1 of each bracket was a Best of 3, but beginning with the Semifinals, sets changed to Best of 5\.

After the tournament concluded, the donation pool–thanks to one last donation from Shak–was at $4,167.69. \[K\]yo and Shak signed off with a goofy 67 emote, another reminder about IPL’s surprise tournament teaser to be announced later, and a heartfelt thank-you to the hard work of the organizers for making Raise 4 RAICES a reality.  

Donations for RAICES closed 24 hours after the stream, where the final donation reached a total of **$4,545.92**\!

The Raise 4 RAICES tournament was a global effort, with tournament staff, creators, commentators, and more around the world participating for a good cause. In addition to those who either played or organized, a handful of artists and players also offered their skills as raffle prizes to donors in the form of art prizes and coaching sessions.
