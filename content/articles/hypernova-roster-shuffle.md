Article ported from the [Splatoon Stronghold](https://www.splatoonstronghold.com/news/a-dying-scene-stronghold-and-splatoon-4) website

[Hypernova](https://sendou.ink/t/hypernova) has moved [Datkid](https://sendou.ink/u/763548554538254346) to the bench and parted ways with [Lexi](https://sendou.ink/u/lexi) as per a text interview with the captain of the team, [Synapse](https://sendou.ink/u/sighnaps). The team has moved forward with [Fishyyism](https://sendou.ink/u/fishyy) and [Captain Happy](https://sendou.ink/u/891117921642876948) as new members of the team to fill the starting positions.

[Synapse stated](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wgVOOMwMhFLngFOCvMc1aF_79c4F3gBCwA5yI76caWQ/edit?usp=drivesdk) that Lexi was planning to cease competing in Splatoon for the foreseeable future. This was also backed by a now deleted post on X by Lexi stating that after [Splat World Series](http://play.iplabs.ink/sws-finals) and [Riptide](https://www.start.gg/tournament/riptide-2025-4/event/splatoon-3/overview) she will no longer be competing. As for Datkid, he plans to continue competing in Splatoon and for Hypernova, but he will be taking a step-back to focus on his academics and extracurricular activities. He will take Hypernova‚Äôs fifth spot as a substitute player.

This team was [founded recently](http://x.com/hypernova_spl) in March of this year. It seeks to be a spiritual successor to previous Splatoon team Sonder. The original roster played weekly events as a pickup with varying members until they decided to form as a team to compete in top-level events under the name Hypernova. Since then, they have competed in and qualified for major events such as [SendouQ Season 7 Finale](https://sendou.ink/to/1277/brackets), [SuperJump 5](https://www.start.gg/tournament/superjump-5-1/details), and Splat World Series. They placed 5th, 4th, and 13th in each event respectively.

The team was looking to continue competing for major events such as [SendouQ Season 8 Finale](https://sendou.ink/to/2091/brackets). They were able to find Fishyyism and Captain Happy in the Plus server who were also looking for a group to qualify for the event. Fishy has been a free agent that has been playing with pick-up groups and consistently placing top 16 in open level monthlies and top 4 in open level weeklies. Fishy‚Äôs last consistent team was KRiSPy/FRiKPy for [LUTI Season 16 Div X](https://sendou.ink/to/1241/brackets) and SendouQ Season 6 Finale. Captain Happy has a similar history of playing in open level events and playing with Fishy in pick-up groups. His last consistent team was Facade during LUTI Season 16 Div X.

They began playing as a group [publicly in SendouQ](https://sendou.ink/q/match/87618) starting August 12th and were able to secure their spot on the [SendouQ Season 8 Leaderboard](https://sendou.ink/q/match/87618) in 10th place at the end of the season. They also competed in [Megalodon Monday NA 34](https://sendou.ink/to/1960/brackets) where they placed 2nd in the event. Synapse states that after these successes, they were invited to play long-term with the team.

The team has found continuous success after the roster changes. They placed 5th in SendouQ Season 8 Finale and continue to increase their lead on their lifetime head-to-head score against [Moonlight](http://sendou.ink/t/Moonlight). The team is now up 5-1 in tournament sets against Moonlight since the team‚Äôs inception in March.

The team also continues to innovate interesting compositions focused around the player‚Äôs unique weapon pools. Datkid added a very unique aspect to this team being an Inkbrush main. With him stepping back, Fishy plans to push a different niche main weapon. Planetz Big Swig is Fishy‚Äôs weapon of choice according to Synapse and his best mechanical weapon. It was seen during the [SendouQ Season 8 Finale on Urchin](https://www.youtube.com/live/iztMH-FFfj4?si=W1RhHiW-IL7OROdH&t=783), but Synapse says that Fishy plans to bring the weapon to more map modes when he is not needed on a specific weapon. Synapse himself is also planning to push Dapple Dualies and double Dapple compositions. He used to primarily play shooters such as the Gals and Splattershot Pro FRZ-N, but now plans to focus primarily on playing Dapple Dualies.

Hypernova‚Äôs coach, [Kbot](http://sendou.ink/u/kbot273), has been a huge help in the team solidifying their identity and finding weapon compositions that incorporate their unique weapon choices while still being well-rounded. Having a substitute on the roster also allows them to practice more consistently with their coach as they have more members to rely on. Synapse states that Kbot has been a great help in understanding the game and refocusing on improvement. In Synapse‚Äôs words, 

‚ÄúHonestly, we were a team that did not take VOD reviewing seriously. In fact, we never did it. We had no planning, goals, or vision each time we played. Kbot has given us these to follow. He has given us the knowledge to greatly improve both individually and collectively. I have been very thankful for him being willing to work with us so far. It has been such a great feeling to not only be on a team (in the state of comp mainly being team-less for some time now), but also having one of the best coaches‚Ä¶ in the scene.‚Äù

Hypernova plans to continue competing in top-level events and perform even better. They will be playing in Riptide this weekend with Lexi where that will be her final event with the team for the time being. The team‚Äôs stated goals are to make the top cut in the SendouQ Season 9 Finale and play in the [Splatoon NA League](http://x.com/NintendoVS/status/1962909394133213589). Synapse leaves this last message to fans of Hypernova,

‚ÄúI am glad of the support we have gotten from others\! To Hypernova‚Äôs fans, I just want to thank you for believing in us and that we are just getting started not only for the unorthodox comps but also our presence in the high level scene. For our goals, getting to \[the\] top cut in the next \[SendouQ Season\] Finale is definitely one of them. I think another goal is the \[Splatoon 3 North American League\] that is going to be announced soon. For a more general goal, it is to find/play consistent comps to continue our way up to the top.‚Äù
